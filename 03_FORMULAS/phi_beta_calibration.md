# φ/2 and β Calibration

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Paper:** 18 — φ/2 and β in Segmented Spacetime: Calibration

---

## Concept

The calibration paper establishes how the parameters φ/2 and β enter the SSZ metric. The natural boundary radius of a dark star is:

```
r_φ = (φ/2) · r_s · [1 + β · Δ(M)]
```

where Δ(M) is a mass-dependent correction.

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| φ | 1.618034... | Golden ratio, fundamental growth factor |
| φ/2 | 0.809017... | Half golden ratio, metric scaling |
| β | Derived | Mass-dependent correction coefficient |
| Δ(M) | Mass-dependent | Deviation from universal scaling |

## Calibration Method

- φ is NOT fitted — it emerges from the segmentation geometry
- β is derived from the requirement of C²-continuity at regime boundaries
- Anti-circularity principle: no calibration against predicted data
