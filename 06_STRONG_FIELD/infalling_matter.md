# Infalling Matter and Radio Waves

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Paper:** 05 — Segmented Spacetime: Infalling Matter and Radiowaves

## Concept

In SSZ, infalling matter approaching a dark star is never lost behind an event horizon. Instead, it encounters a region of extreme segmentation where time dilation is finite (D(r_s) = 0.555) rather than zero. Light emitted by infalling matter is transformed into highly redshifted radio waves.

## Key Predictions

| Observable | SSZ Prediction | GR Prediction |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Matter fate at r_s | Slowed but not frozen | Frozen / lost |
| Light from r_s | Radio waves (z = 0.802) | No escape |
| Information | Preserved | Lost (paradox) |
| Radio emission | Detectable with SKA | None expected |

## Dual Velocity Framework

Infalling matter has two velocity components (Paper 02):

```
v_total = v_fall + v_eigen
```

- **v_fall:** gravitational infall velocity
- **v_eigen:** intrinsic velocity of matter
- At r_s, both are finite and well-defined

## Observational Tests

- **SKA (Square Kilometre Array):** Radio emission from infalling matter near compact objects
- **Next-generation EHT:** Resolve radio structures near BH shadows
- **LIGO/LISA:** Modified ringdown from finite D(r_s)
