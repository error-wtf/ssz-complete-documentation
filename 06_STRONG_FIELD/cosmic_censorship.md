## The Natural Boundary

```
r_φ = (φ/2) · r_s · [1 + β · Δ(M)]
```

SSZ defines a natural boundary radius r_φ that acts as an effective minimum approach distance. This is not imposed by hand — it emerges from the φ-geometry of segmentation.

## Cosmic Censorship in SSZ

In GR, cosmic censorship is a **conjecture** (unproven): naked singularities should not exist in nature.

In SSZ, cosmic censorship is a **consequence**:
- Ξ saturates at 0.802 — no divergence
- D remains finite and positive — no singularity to "censor"
- The natural boundary r_φ provides structural protection

## Normal Clock Condition

At r_φ:
- Clocks still tick (D > 0)
- The "normal clock" condition is satisfied
- Physical processes remain well-defined
