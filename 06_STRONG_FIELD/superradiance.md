## The Problem

Superradiant instabilities occur in rotating black holes (Kerr BHs) when bosonic fields extract rotational energy. In GR, this can lead to runaway amplification — the "black hole bomb" scenario.

## SSZ Stabilization

SSZ naturally regulates superradiance because:

1. **Bounded Ξ:** The segment density saturates at Ξ_max = 0.802, preventing infinite amplification
2. **Finite D:** Time dilation at the horizon is D = 0.555 (not zero), so the amplification condition is modified
3. **No ergoregion singularity:** The SSZ metric doesn't develop the extreme properties that enable unlimited energy extraction

### SSZ Superradiance Formula
```
G_SSZ = exp[∫γ ds] · ∏ e^{-λ_A σ(θ_k)} · R(1-K)
S = Δ_unstable + ⟨Δlog G⟩
```

The gain factor G_SSZ is bounded, unlike the GR version which can diverge.

## Physical Consequence

- SSZ predicts **stable** rapidly-rotating compact objects
- No superradiant "explosion" or runaway energy extraction
- Modified spin-down rates for near-extremal objects
- Testable via gravitational wave ringdown (LISA, 2034+)
