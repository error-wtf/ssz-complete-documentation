## The Black Hole Bomb Problem

In GR, superradiant scattering can extract rotational energy from a Kerr black hole. With a confining mechanism (e.g., massive bosons), this creates an exponentially growing instability — the "black hole bomb."

## SSZ Stabilization

SSZ provides a natural regulator through:

```
G_SSZ = exp[∫γ ds] · ∏ e^{-λ_A σ(θ_k)} · R(1-K)
S = Δ_unstable + ⟨Δlog G⟩
```

The S-index quantifies stability. SSZ's segment density provides:
1. **Natural damping** through Ξ-dependent effective potential modifications
2. **Saturation ceiling** preventing runaway growth
3. **Finite horizon effects** modifying the superradiance condition

---

## Result

The SSZ framework naturally prevents the black hole bomb instability without additional assumptions, because the segment density saturates and D remains finite at the horizon.
