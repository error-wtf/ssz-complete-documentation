# Paradox of Singularities and SSZ Resolution

## The GR Problem

In General Relativity, the Schwarzschild metric has a coordinate singularity at r = r_s:
```
D_GR(r_s) = √(1 - r_s/r_s) = 0
g_tt → 0,  g_rr → ∞
```

Time stops, the metric degenerates, and physical interpretation breaks down.

## The SSZ Resolution

SSZ resolves this by saturation:
```
Ξ(r_s) = 1 - exp(-φ) = 0.802   (finite)
D(r_s) = 1/(1 + 0.802) = 0.555  (finite, non-zero)
```

**Time does not stop at the horizon.** The clock rate is reduced but remains positive.

## What This Means

| Property | GR | SSZ |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Time at horizon | Stops (D=0) | Slowed (D=0.555) |
| Singularity | Yes (coordinate) | **No** |
| Information | Lost? (paradox) | Preserved |
| dD/dr at r_s | Infinite | Finite |
| Physical interpretation | Breaks down | Regular |

## No Point Masses

SSZ's saturation principle prevents the formation of true point singularities. The segment density Ξ saturates at Ξ_max = 0.802, providing a natural regularization without introducing new physics below the Planck scale.
