## The Problem in GR

In General Relativity, the Schwarzschild metric has two singularities:

1. **Coordinate singularity at r = r_s:** g_tt = 0, g_rr → ∞
   - Removable via coordinate change (Eddington-Finkelstein, Kruskal-Szekeres)
   - But still implies infinite redshift: z → ∞

2. **Physical singularity at r = 0:** Curvature diverges
   - Not removable by any coordinate change
   - All known physics breaks down

## SSZ Resolution

### At r = r_s (Horizon)
SSZ produces **finite** values where GR diverges:

```
Ξ(r_s) = 1 - e^(-φ) = 0.80171
D(r_s) = 1/(1 + 0.80171) = 0.55503
z(r_s) = 0.80171
```

| Property | GR | SSZ |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Time dilation D | 0 | **0.555** |
| Redshift z | ∞ | **0.802** |
| Metric g_tt | 0 | **-0.308** |
| Metric g_rr | ∞ | **3.248** |
| Proper time dτ | 0 | **> 0** |
| Curvature | Finite | **Finite** |

### At r → 0 (Center)
SSZ's Ξ_strong formula:
```
Ξ_strong(r→0) = 1 - exp(-φ·r_s/r) → 1 - 0 = 1
```
So Ξ → 1 (bounded), D → 1/2 (finite), and all metric components remain finite.

**SSZ has NO singularities** — neither coordinate nor physical.

## Physical Consequences

1. **No information paradox:** Since D(r_s) > 0, time does not freeze at the horizon. Information can (in principle) propagate through.

2. **No firewall:** The metric is smooth at r_s, so an infalling observer experiences no divergence.

3. **Finite entropy:** With bounded Ξ, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy calculation is modified but remains finite.

4. **Observable surface:** The "horizon" in SSZ is not a true event horizon but a **high-segmentation surface** with extreme but finite redshift.

## The Dark Star Interpretation

Instead of a black hole with an event horizon, SSZ predicts a **dark star**:
- Extremely redshifted surface (z = 0.802 at r_s)
- Finite time dilation (D = 0.555)
- Light can escape, but heavily redshifted
- Observationally very similar to a GR black hole from afar
