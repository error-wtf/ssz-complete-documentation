# The Dark Star

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Paper:** 09 — Segmented Spacetime and the Dark Star Problem

---

## Concept

In SSZ, the traditional "black hole" with an event horizon and singularity is replaced by a **dark star** — a compact object with extreme but finite segmentation.

---

## Properties

| Property | GR Black Hole | SSZ Dark Star |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Singularity | Yes (r=0) | **No** |
| Event horizon | Yes (r=r_s) | **No** (high-Ξ surface) |
| Light escape | Impossible from r<r_s | **Possible** (highly redshifted) |
| Time dilation at r_s | D=0 (frozen) | **D=0.555** (slow but not frozen) |
| Redshift at r_s | z=∞ | **z=0.802** |
| Information loss | Yes (paradox) | **No** (information preserved) |
| Entropy | Bekenstein-Hawking | Modified but finite |

## Observational Signatures

### BH Shadow
SSZ predicts a shadow diameter **-1.3% smaller** than GR:
- Current EHT resolution cannot distinguish this
- Next-generation EHT (ngEHT, 2028-2030) may reach sufficient precision

### Photon Sphere
The photon sphere at r = 3r_s/2 is modified:
- SSZ gives stronger lensing effects near the photon sphere
- SSZ predicts 82% of photon-sphere observables better than GR in the 2.2-3.0 r/r_s range

### Ringdown Frequencies
Gravitational wave ringdown frequencies would be modified:
- Detectable with LISA (2034+)
- Frequency shift proportional to D(r_s) difference

## The Natural Boundary

Instead of an event horizon, SSZ predicts a **natural boundary** at:
```
r_φ = (φ/2) · r_s · [1 + β · Δ(M)]
```

This is the radius where segmentation effects become dominant. It is:
- Mass-dependent (through Δ(M))
- Not a causal barrier (unlike the event horizon)
- The practical "edge" of the dark star

## Infalling Matter

Matter falling toward a dark star (Paper 05):
```
v_total = v_fall + v_eigen
```

- Matter approaches the high-Ξ surface but is never "lost"
- Extreme redshift makes the surface nearly unobservable
- Radio waves from infalling matter are predicted (testable with SKA)
