# Dark Star Problem

**Paper:** 09 (Segmented Spacetime and the Dark Star Problem)

## Historical Lineage

```
Michell (1783) → Laplace (1796) → Schwarzschild (1916) → SSZ (2025)
```

- **Michell/Laplace:** Newtonian "dark stars" where v_esc > c
- **Schwarzschild:** GR solution with horizon singularity
- **SSZ:** Resolution with finite D(r_s) = 0.555

## SSZ Perspective

The dark star is reinterpreted through SSZ:
- Escape velocity v_esc = c at r = r_s (same as GR)
- But time dilation D(r_s) = 0.555 (finite, unlike GR's D=0)
- Light is strongly redshifted (z = 0.802) but not infinitely so
- The object appears "dark" due to extreme redshift, not infinite time dilation

## Implications

- Black holes in SSZ are "very dark" objects, not "infinitely dark" ones
- The information paradox is softened: D > 0 means processes continue
- The historical dark star concept is closer to SSZ than to standard GR
