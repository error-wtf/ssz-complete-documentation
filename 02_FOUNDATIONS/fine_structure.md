# Fine-Structure Constant as Geometric Projection

## Concept

The fine-structure constant α is not a fixed constant but a **geometric projection** of local spacetime segmentation. Near massive objects, space is more finely segmented, reducing the electromagnetically accessible fraction of electron rest energy and thus the effective α.

---

## Key Formula

Effective radius in segmented space:

```
r = φ / N_e
```

where N_e is the number of segments for an electron and φ is the fundamental segment length.

---

## Key Results

- α varies with local segmentation density
- Near Sgr A*: increased segmentation → decreased effective α
- Observed S2 frequency shift reproduced without Doppler or metric expansion
- α emerges as coupling limit imposed by spatial structure

---

## Physical Interpretation

- Electron rest energy is partitioned by segmentation
- Only a fraction (proportional to α) is electromagnetically accessible
- This fraction depends on local Ξ(r)
- In flat space (Ξ → 0): α takes its standard value ≈ 1/137
