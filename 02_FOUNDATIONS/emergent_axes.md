# Emergent Spatial Axes

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Paper:** 14 — Emergent Spatial Axes from Orthogonal Temporal Interference

---

## Concept

Space emerges from the interference of two orthogonal time-like dimensions: proper time (t_x) and observer time (t_y). Superimposing directional sinusoidal projections produces a quasiperiodic intensity field with 5-fold or 10-fold rotational symmetry.

## Key Results

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Time axes | t_x (proper), t_y (observer) |
| Symmetry | 5-fold / 10-fold rotational |
| Spatial structure | Emerges from temporal interference |
| Connection to SSZ | Segmentation is the emergence mechanism |
| Analogy | Quasicrystal projections |

## Physical Interpretation

- **t_y axis:** Spherical symmetry — external observational perspective
- **t_x axis:** Sequential structural events — internal proper time
- Segmentation density determines the resolution of emergent space
- Near massive objects: finer segmentation → more spatial detail

## Connection to Other Papers

- Paper 03 (Frequency Framework): Frequency as fundamental quantity
- Paper 13 (π and φ): Structural constants govern segmentation
- Paper 20 (Temporal Growth): φ as temporal growth function
