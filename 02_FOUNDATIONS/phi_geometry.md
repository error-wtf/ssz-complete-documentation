# φ-Geometry in SSZ

**Status:** CANONICAL

---

## The Golden Ratio as Structural Constant

```
φ = (1 + √5) / 2 = 1.618033988749895...
```

In SSZ, φ is not decorative numerology. It enters as a **constraint** that determines:
- The exponential scale of strong-field segmentation
- The saturation value of Ξ at the horizon
- The coupling between mass scales
- The geometry of regime transitions

## Where φ Appears

### 1. Strong-Field Segment Density
```
Ξ_strong(r) = 1 - exp(-φ · r_s / r)
```
φ sets the e-folding scale. Without φ, the saturation value would be arbitrary.

### 2. Horizon Value
```
Ξ(r_s) = 1 - e^(-φ) = 0.80171
D(r_s) = 1/(1 + 0.80171) = 0.55503
```
The fact that D(r_s) is finite (not 0 or ∞) is a direct consequence of using φ.

### 3. Coupling Radius
```
r_φ = (φ/2) · r_s · [1 + β · Δ(M)]
```
The factor φ/2 = 0.80902 couples the Schwarzschild radius to the segmentation structure.

### 4. Frequency Grid (φ-Gitter)
```
R = 1 + z = φ^N,    N ∈ ℤ
```
Redshift values that are powers of φ define a discrete scaling grid.

### 5. Euler Embedding
```
z_k = r₀ · e^{k(ln φ + iΔθ)}
```
The logarithmic spiral:
```
r(θ) = r₀ · e^{bθ}
b = ln(φ) / Δθ ≈ 0.306
```

### 6. Fine-Structure Constant
```
α = e²/(4πε₀ℏc) ≈ 1/137.036
```
SSZ proposes a geometric origin: α = f(Ξ), making the fine-structure constant position-dependent in strong fields.

### 7. Electron Radius
```
r_e = φ / N_e
```
φ-motivated scaling for bound-state structures.

## The Spiral Motif

Segmentation grows like a **logarithmic spiral** rather than a smooth polynomial. This is not metaphorical — the growth law:
```
Ξ(r) ∝ 1 - exp(-φ · r_s/r)
```
has the same functional form as approach to equilibrium along a φ-scaled coordinate.

The spiral/φ aspect means segmentation behaves as a structured "densification" rather than smooth continuum curvature alone. SSZ does not deny curvature — rather, it treats gravitational behavior as curvature **plus** an additional segment-density structure.

## Why φ and Not Some Other Constant?

The authors' claim:
1. φ is the unique positive root of x² = x + 1 → self-similar scaling
2. φ-geometry produces the only Ξ_strong formula that simultaneously:
   - Saturates at the correct horizon value
   - Intersects Ξ_weak at a mass-independent r*
   - Matches PPN tests in the weak field
3. Replacing φ with any other constant breaks at least one of these constraints

This is an empirical claim about consistency, not a proof from first principles.
