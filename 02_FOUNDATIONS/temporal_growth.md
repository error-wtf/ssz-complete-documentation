# φ as Temporal Growth Function

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Paper:** 20 — Segmented Spacetime and φ as a Temporal Growth Function

## Concept

The golden ratio φ is not merely a geometric constant but a **temporal growth function** that governs the rate at which spacetime segments accumulate under gravitational influence. As gravity increases, the normal clock expands, and φ describes the self-similar growth pattern.

## Key Results

- φ drives the logarithmic spiral: r(θ) = r₀·e^(kθ)
- Each quarter-turn adds φ-segments to the clock
- Time dilation arises from increased segment traversal per cycle
- At r = 1 (normal clock): 2φ = π (topological constraint)

---

## Physical Mechanism

1. Stronger gravity → larger clock radius
2. Larger radius → more φ-segments per cycle
3. More segments → more time per traversal
4. Result: gravitational time dilation from segment counting
