# Time Dilation D(r)

**Status:** CANONICAL

---

## The SSZ Time-Dilation Factor

```
D_SSZ(r) = 1 / (1 + Ξ(r))
```

This is the ratio of proper time (τ) to coordinate time (t):
```
dτ = D_SSZ(r) · dt
```

## Comparison with GR

```
D_GR(r)  = √(1 - r_s/r)
D_SSZ(r) = 1/(1 + Ξ(r))
```

| Property | D_GR | D_SSZ |
|----------|------|-------|
| r → ∞ | 1 | 1 |
| r = r_s | **0** (singular) | **0.555** (finite) |
| r < r_s | Imaginary | Still finite |
| Monotonic | Yes | Yes |
| Smooth | Yes (except r_s) | Yes (everywhere) |

## Gravitational Redshift from D

```
z_SSZ(r) = 1/D(r) - 1 = Ξ(r)
```

For two observers at r₁ and r₂:
```
1 + z = D(r_obs) / D(r_emit) = (1 + Ξ_emit) / (1 + Ξ_obs)
```

---

## Scaling Factor

The scaling factor s(r) is the reciprocal of time dilation:
```
s(r) = 1/D(r) = 1 + Ξ(r)
```

This appears in:
- Radial scaling gauge: dρ = s(r)·dr
- Maxwell equations: E' = s·E, B' = s·B
- Light-travel time: Δt_grav = ∫ Ξ(r) dr/c

---

## Weak-Field Expansion

For Ξ ≪ 1 (weak field):
```
D_SSZ ≈ 1 - Ξ + Ξ² - Ξ³ + ...
D_GR  ≈ 1 - r_s/(2r) + ...
```

With Ξ_weak = r_s/(2r):
```
D_SSZ ≈ 1 - r_s/(2r) + O(r_s²/r²)
```

Identical to GR's first-order expansion → **SSZ recovers GR in the weak field.**

## Horizon Behavior (CRITICAL)

### GR at r = r_s
```
D_GR(r_s) = √(1 - 1) = 0    → Infinite redshift, frozen time
```

### SSZ at r = r_s
```
Ξ(r_s) = 1 - e^(-φ) = 0.80171
D_SSZ(r_s) = 1/(1 + 0.80171) = 0.55503
```

**D is finite!** Consequences:
- Time does not freeze at the horizon
- Redshift is finite (z = 0.802, not ∞)
- No information paradox from frozen surfaces
- No singularity in the time-dilation function
