# Confusion Prevention Strategy

---

## 3-Layer Strategy

### Layer 1: ENTRY (Always first)
Read the **Prime Directive** → Golden rule, method selection

### Layer 2: RULES (When uncertain)
Read the **Method Assignment** → 7 binding rules, decision tree

### Layer 3: REFERENCE (For details)
Read the **Formula Compendium** → Complete formulas, regime tables

## The r*/r_s Question: Two Correct Values

This is NOT a contradiction:

| Value | Origin | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| r*/r_s ≈ 1.595 | Ξ_weak(r) = r_s/(2r) ∩ D_GR | Weak-field proxy intersection |
| r*/r_s ≈ 1.387 | Ξ_strong(r) = 1-exp(-φr_s/r) ∩ D_GR | Strong-field intersection |

Both are **correct domain markers** for their respective Ξ forms. The bridge between weak and strong is a controlled regime transition (Hermite C² blend).

## Common Confusion Scenarios

### "The repos give different results!"
→ Check: Are they using the same scope, method, and regime?

### "I get 50% of the GR value!"
→ Check: Is it a null observable? Use PPN (1+γ) factor.

### "The formula looks different from another repo!"
→ Check: Different scopes use different Ξ forms. This is by design.

### "Δ(M) gives wrong results in weak field!"
→ Check: Δ(M) is ONLY for strong field. Weak field = exact GR.

## For New Sessions

1. Check the Prime Directive
2. Classify your observable
3. Select the correct method
4. Verify the regime
5. Then calculate

> **Observable → Class → Method → Scope → Then calculate.**
