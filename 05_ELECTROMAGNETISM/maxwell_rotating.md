## Concept

In SSZ, electromagnetic waves can be interpreted as manifestations of rotating spatial structure within segmented spacetime.

## Scaled Maxwell Equations

```
∇ · (s² E) = 0
∇ × (s² B) = μ₀ε₀ s² ∂E/∂t
```

The scaling factor s(r) = 1 + Ξ(r) modifies Maxwell's equations by entering as s².

## Spiral Structure

The connection between EM propagation and spiral geometry:
- Light follows paths modified by the segment density
- The spiral motif of φ-geometry naturally describes wave propagation
- Logarithmic spiral: r(θ) = r₀ · e^{bθ} with b = lnφ/Δθ

This is consistent with the Euler embedding from Paper 06.
