| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Anti-circularity** | Design principle ensuring no circular dependencies in SSZ's derivation chain |
| **Blend zone** | Radial range 1.8 ≤ r/r_s ≤ 2.2 where Hermite C² interpolation connects weak and strong regimes |
| **C² continuity** | Continuity of value, first derivative, and second derivative at regime boundaries |
| **Coherence-collapse** | Irreversible transition from g₁ (weak) to g₂ (strong) regime |
| **Coupling radius r_φ** | Radius where φ-geometry defines the natural boundary: r_φ = (φ/2)r_s[1+βΔ(M)] |
| **Dark star** | Historical concept (Michell/Laplace) of objects where v_esc > c; reinterpreted in SSZ |
| **Dual velocities** | Pair (v_esc, v_fall) satisfying v_esc × v_fall = c² |
| **Falsification** | Process of testing SSZ predictions against observations; SSZ is designed to be easily falsifiable |
| **g₁ regime** | Weak-field regime where SSZ = GR |
| **g₂ regime** | Strong-field regime with Ξ saturation |
| **Golden ratio φ** | (1+√5)/2 = 1.618...; structural constant in SSZ |
| **Guardrails** | Documentation rules preventing cross-repo confusion |
| **Hermite interpolation** | Quintic polynomial ensuring C² smoothness in the blend zone |
| **Kinematic closure** | The identity v_esc × v_fall = c² |
| **Natural boundary** | Minimum approach radius r_φ from φ-geometry |
| **Observable classification** | Sorting observables into null/timelike-static/timelike-orbit categories |
| **PPN (Parameterized Post-Newtonian)** | Formalism for testing gravity theories; SSZ has β=γ=1 |
| **Prime Directive** | Never use a single method for all observables |
| **Radial scaling gauge** | s(r) = 1+Ξ(r) applied to Maxwell fields |
| **Regime** | Radial zone (weak/blend/strong) determining which Ξ formula to use |
| **Scaling factor s(r)** | s = 1 + Ξ = 1/D; scales EM fields and physical distances |
| **Schwarzschild radius r_s** | r_s = 2GM/c² |
| **Segment density Ξ(r)** | Dimensionless field quantifying spacetime segmentation |
| **Segmented Spacetime (SSZ)** | Falsifiable GR extension built on segment density Ξ |
| **Superradiance** | Energy extraction from rotating BH; SSZ provides natural stabilization |
| **Time dilation D(r)** | D = 1/(1+Ξ); proper-time to coordinate-time ratio |
| **Universal intersection r*** | r*/r_s = 1.595 where D_SSZ = D_GR exactly |
