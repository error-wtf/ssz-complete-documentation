# SSZ Core Postulates

---

## Postulate 1: Segment Density Field

There exists a dimensionless scalar field Ξ(r) — the **segment density** — that quantifies the degree of spacetime segmentation at radial coordinate r from a central mass M.

---

## Postulate 2: Minimal Time Dilation Law

```
D_SSZ(r) = 1 / (1 + Ξ(r))
dτ = D_SSZ(r) · dt
```

---

## Postulate 3: Two-Regime Structure

**Weak Field (g₁):** For r/r_s > 10:
```
Ξ_weak(r) = r_s / (2r)
```

**Strong Field (g₂):** For r/r_s < 1.8:
```
Ξ_strong(r) = 1 - exp(-φ · r_s / r)
```

**Blend Zone:** 1.8 ≤ r/r_s ≤ 2.2 — Hermite C² interpolation.

## Postulate 4: φ-Geometry Constraint

The golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 enters as a structural scaling constant, not a fitting parameter.

---

## Postulate 5: Anti-Fitting Discipline

- No free parameters per object
- Δ(M) derives from φ-geometry, NOT data fitting
- All constants from external sources (CODATA, BIPM, mathematics)
- Validation data was NEVER used for calibration

---

## Postulate 6: Observable Classification

| Observable Type | Method |
|----------------|--------|
| Timelike (clocks, redshift) | Ξ-based: D = 1/(1+Ξ) |
| Null (light paths) | PPN: (1+γ) completion |
| Orbit (precession) | PPN: (β, γ) machinery |

---

## Postulate 7: Falsifiability

SSZ makes specific, quantitative predictions differing from GR in strong fields. No post-hoc parameter adjustment is permitted.
