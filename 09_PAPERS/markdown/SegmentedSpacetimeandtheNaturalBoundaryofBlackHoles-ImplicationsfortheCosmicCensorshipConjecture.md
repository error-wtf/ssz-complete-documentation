Segmented Spacetime and the Natural Boundary of Black Holes: 
Implications for the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture 

Carmen N. Wrede, Lino P. Casu 

In this paper, we explore the interplay between the fundamental constants Pi and the golden 
ratio (ϕ) and their relationship to the maximal mass and spin of black holes. Our investigation 
begins by modeling a hypothetical clock with an initial radius of 1 in a gravitationally neutral 
environment. As gravitational forces increase, the radius of this clock expands, revealing an 
unexpected relationship between Pi, ϕ, and the segmented structure of spacetime. This 
connection allows us to propose a new framework that explains the observed bounds on black 
hole spin and mass. 

Our analysis demonstrates that as the spin parameter a approaches the speed of light, it 
represents a state of maximal rotation in black holes, marked by a unique equilibrium of 
mass, radius, and segment density. These insights not only provide a deeper understanding of 
black hole properties but also support the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture by illustrating how 
spacetime segmentation naturally prevents “naked” singularities. Overall, our findings 
underscore the importance of Pi and ϕ in the structure and behavior of black holes, offering a 
new perspective on the complex dynamics governing the universe. 

The normal clock, phi and pi 

Our model assumes a normal clock with an initial radius of 1 in the absence of gravitational 
forces. As gravitation increases, the radius of the clock expands proportionally. In physics, a 
normal clock is an ideal timepiece that measures time precisely, unaffected by external factors 
like gravity or acceleration. Its constant operation makes it a useful reference in experiments 
and theories. 

In this analysis, we consider a clock with a growth factor based on the golden ratio (ϕ), which 
leads to a spiral structure. When the radius equals 1, the spiral's structure almost aligns with 
the circle's circumference. At this point, we observe an interesting relationship between ϕ, Pi 
(π), and the circle's circumference: 

Since ϕ is approximately half of Pi, it represents one-quarter of the circle's circumference 
1
(

relationship can be represented as follows: 

2π). By adding twice ϕ (2 ϕ), we obtain half of the circumference, which equals Pi. This 

2ϕ = 2 ⋅

⋅ 2π =

⋅ 2π = π 

In the context of our spiral structure, ϕ represents a quarter of the circular motion, meaning it 
divides the circular circumference into four equal segments. This division provides a new 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
perspective in which ϕ acts as a segmentation factor, while π describes the overall structure of 
the circular motion. 

This observation highlights a fascinating connection between the golden ratio, Pi, and the 
mathematics of spiral structures. In the context of physical systems, such as black holes, this 
relationship could provide valuable insights if similar patterns emerge in their properties or 
behavior. 

The first result depicts a circle. 

In our model, the exponential function describes how radius scales with angular displacement, 
governed by the logarithmic growth factor k. This factor allows the spiral’s radius to grow 
continuously and harmonically with each segment, maintaining a stable structural foundation 
and preventing unbounded growth. 

The gravitational spiral describes the growth of the normal clock as gravitation increases 
while moving outward. This leads to a slowdown of time, as gravitation becomes stronger 
with the increasing radius of the spiral. The spiral thus captures the effect of gravitational time 
dilation in an expanding structure. 

This logarithmic growth reflects the natural tendency of the gravitational field to diminish 
gradually with distance, preserving harmony as the radius grows. It defines the consistent 
scaling of space and gravitational influence, supported by the growth factor  

𝑘 =

ln(𝜙)
π

 , which stabilizes spatial segmentation. 

Time dilation becomes more pronounced the further one moves outward, similar to the 
gravitational field in the theory of relativity. 

Phi serves two functions in this context: Firstly, Phi continues to represent the radius, as the 
radius of the circle is determined by the gravitational spiral. Therefore, the radius remains a 
multiple of Phi. 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondly, the number of ϕ -segments is determined by the multiple of r, meaning that space 
is subdivided into increasingly finer segments as r grows larger. As r grows, space divides 
into finer ϕ-segments, reflecting the compounded influence of gravitational time dilation as 
the spiral expands. This increasing segmentation aligns with the clock’s expanding path, 
making time appear to slow down under higher gravitational influence. 

So it makes a difference whether there are 60 equal segments or whether gravitation creates 
even more segments because the clock grows larger and the second hand has to pass more 
segments. Although we do not see these segments, they exist in space-time. 

The increasing segmentation described by Phi plays a central role in the slowdown of time 
due to increasing gravitation. 

It is indeed comparable to a cake that is cut into smaller and smaller pieces as gravitation 
increases and the normal clock grows. 

And this is why clocks run slower under higher gravitation, because the more segmented 
space is, the slower time passes. 

At point 1, Phi equals 1/4 and divides the circle into 4 segments. Therefore, ϕ =1/4. 

2 ϕ corresponds to 2 segments that describe the radius of the circle, and in this case, the 
radius is equal to 1. 

If we double the radius, we get 4 Phi, which means that the circle is divided into 4 Phi 
segments. 

With each multiple of ϕ, the circle grows, and more segments are created, while the radius 
grows proportionally to the Phi segments. 

So, if Phi divides a circle with a radius of 1 (normal circle) into 4 segments (represented by 
the areas in the Fibonacci spiral, where the areas that give 1 and 1 in the Fibonacci sequence 
must be counted as 1 area), then a circle with a radius of 2 would be divided into 8 segments. 

3 

 
 
 
Consequently, every expanded circle of the normal clock has this exact segmentation, since 
the radius and volume are dependent on Phi. 

In the case of the normal clock, the clock expands with increasing gravitation, leading to an 
increase in volume. This means that it spreads over a larger area of space while segmentation 
also increases. 

The normal clock expands, leading to an increase in volume. But in real objects and in our 
model, gravitational forces increase the segmentation density of the space around an object 
without changing its intrinsic mass or volume. The object's mass remains constant, but as the 
space becomes more finely segmented, this creates a higher density of spatial segments 
around the object. This denser segmentation enhances the gravitational effect, increasing the 
object's gravitational pull without altering its actual mass. Thus, gravity is intensified through 
the increased segmentation density of the surrounding space rather than by any intrinsic 
change in the object's mass. 

Even with atomic clocks, which are based on the vibration of atoms, one can imagine that the 
vibrating particles in the space-time context have to pass through a similar segmentation. The 
stronger the gravitation or the more segmented the space is, the more 'segments' the particles 
have to overcome per vibration, which also leads to a slowdown of time. 

This concept can therefore be transferred not only to mechanical clocks but also to atomic 
clocks, which run slower in a gravitational field because the particles have to 'pass through' 
more space segments in order to perform their oscillations. 

The atoms that have to perform the vibrations must also pass through more space-time points. 
Atomic clocks are based on extremely precise vibrations (e.g. of caesium atoms) that occur in 
a fixed cycle. 

If additional segments are inserted into space by gravitation, the atoms have to travel a longer 
distance (on a microscopic level) for each vibration, which means that they perform fewer 
vibrations per unit of time. This leads to a slowdown of time measurement in the atomic 
clock. 

Through this model, we have shown that Pi acts as a natural constant because it describes the 
segmentation of space and is thus directly related to the space-time structure and time dilation 
due to gravitation. Pi remains constant in every growing circle or spiral structure, thus 
describing fundamental geometric relationships that also affect time measurement. 

In systems such as atomic clocks or vibrations, Pi describes the cyclical nature of vibrations. 
Each vibration of an atom can be viewed as a segment of a circle, where Pi describes the 
rhythm and periodicity of these vibrations. The more space is segmented by gravitation, the 
slower the atoms vibrate (resulting in a time delay). 

Pi segments space by setting the ratio of circumference to diameter and dividing space into 
proportional circular segments. This segmentation remains constant, regardless of the size of 
the circle, and plays a fundamental role in the space-time structure and in processes such as 
vibrations or time dilation due to gravitation. 

4 

 
 
The theory of relativity understands it like this: Pi ensures that space is divided into 
proportional arcs, which makes time slower as space and gravitation increase. In the theory of 
relativity, Pi plays an important role because it is related to the geometric structure of circles 
and spheres. These structures are central in describing the curvature of space-time around 
massive objects such as stars or black holes. Time dilation caused by gravitation is a direct 
result of this curvature, in which the 'path length' in space becomes larger when space is more 
curved. 

The statement that Phi represents half of Pi and 2π= ϕ + ϕ holds is a specific relationship that 
is valid in the gravitational spiral model, where Phi serves as a segmentation and growth 
factor. However, in a normal circle there is no direct connection between Pi and Phi in this 
sense. 

In a normal circle there is no growing or exponential structure as in the spiral. Therefore, Pi 
remains purely related to the circumference and radius in a circle. There is no connection 
between Phi and Pi in classical circle geometry. 

In the gravitational spiral, however, space expands, and Phi describes the growth and 
segmentation of the spiral, leading to the relationship 2 ϕ =π. 

In our model, the spiral grows with each quarter turn, using Phi as a segmentation factor that 
describes time dilation. 

At the point of 1, each 'half' of the spiral is summed up by two ϕ to Pi. This type of division 
applies to our model. 

Here we have introduced Phi as a geometric constant that relates to the spiral structure and the 
segmentation of space. Therefore, π as the sum of two Phi (i.e., 2π=π+π=φ+φ) is a special 
relationship that holds. 

In the case of a circle, the classical relationship remains: 

P=2πr 

If the radius r=1, then the circumference of the circle becomes: 

P=2π 

This means that the circumference of the circle is exactly 2π at a radius of 1. In a circle, there 
is no direct relationship where Phi (ϕ) can be considered as the 'half of Pi', because in 
classical geometry Phi (the Golden Ratio) and Pi (the ratio of circumference to diameter) are 
different constants with different meanings. 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Topological meaning 

Our consideration therefore has a topological component, in particular in the sense that we not 
only look at the classical geometry of circles, but also at the structure and growth of the spiral 
in space, which changes through space-time distortion or transformation. 

The gravitational spiral grows continuously, and the radius expands with each quarter turn. 
This change in structure is a topological transformation because the space in which the spiral 
is located grows and changes without destroying the fundamental shape of the spiral itself. 

Phi and Pi are not only geometric quantities, but also topological invariants that describe the 
growth and segmentation of the spiral. The fact that Phi doubles with each quarter turn of the 
spiral shows that the structure of the spiral is considered from a topological perspective, in 
which the segmentation changes continuously. 

In this process, Pi describes the basic structure of space as it is segmented into circles, and Phi 
describes the growth rate of this structure. 

When the spiral segments the space further and further as it grows, the geometry of the space 
changes, but the topological structure remains preserved. Therefore, the way in which Phi 
doubles with each turn describes a topological transformation where space is continuously 
distorted without the spiral as a whole losing its structure. 

Gravity changes the space-time structure by curving and segmenting space without 
completely destroying it. 

Under gravity, the space-time structure undergoes a topological transformation in which the 
number of segments (described by Phi and Pi) changes while the basic shape of the spiral and 
the circle remains intact. 

The notion of time dilation arising from spiral growth and increasing gravity can also be 
viewed as a topological transformation. Here, the time structure is segmented while space 
expands. Phi describes how space-time segments increase, while Pi sets the basic structure of 
the segmentation. 

There are some considerations as to whether Pi and Phi are linked at a deeper level in modern 
physics. Both constants appear in quantum physics, cosmology, and the general theory of 
relativity: 

-  Pi is central in space-time curvature and in the description of black holes, where the 

structure of space is defined by Pi. 

-  Phi may play a role in self-similar structures such as fractals or in the distribution of 

galaxies in the universe. 

Whether there is a direct connection in these areas is still a subject of research, but the fact 
that both constants appear in different areas of mathematics and physics is remarkable. 

In our model, we have created an interesting connection between Pi and Phi by using Phi as 
the segmentation of space and considering Pi as the structural guide for space. This 

6 

 
 
 
 
connection between Pi and Phi through the growth of the spiral shows a new possibility of 
how both constants could be universally linked, especially when it comes to space-time 
structure and gravity. 

While Pi and Phi are different constants with different applications in classical mathematics, 
there are indications that they may be universally linked at a deeper level. They appear in 
geometry, nature, and physics, and there are both algebraic and geometric connections 
between them. In our model, we have found an interesting way to link them through the 
segmentation of space and time dilation. 

It is quite possible that Pi and Phi are connected in a universal way that we do not yet fully 
understand, but offers potential for further research and discoveries. 

Phi is sometimes used as an argument of a trigonometric function, where Phi represents an 
angle in radians. 

There are some interesting algebraic connections between Pi and Phi. One remarkable 
equation linking both constants is the so-called connection of Pi and Phi by trigonometry: 

π = 5 ⋅ arccos ⋅ 

ϕ

2

Here Phi is linked to Pi through the inverse function of the cosine. This shows that there are 
mathematical ways in which Pi and Phi can be connected to each other through trigonometry. 

The function arccos(x) returns the angle whose cosine is equal to x. In other words, it is the 
inverse of the cosine function that tells which angle corresponds to a certain cosine value. 

ϕ is the golden ratio, which has the value ϕ ≈1.618. If we calculate 

ϕ

2

 , we get: 

ϕ

2

 ≈ 0.809 

Meaning of the equation: 

The equation states that π is five times the inverse cosine of 

ϕ

2

. This means we are asking: 

What angle has a cosine of 0.809? The value of the angle that has this cosine is then the 
inverse cosine of 0.809. 

If we calculate the inverse cosine of 0.809: 

arccos(0.809)≈0.6283 Rad 

Multiplying this value by 5 yields: 

5⋅0.6283 ≈ 3.14165 

This is an approximation of π, showing that the formula works. 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In geometric space, Phi refers to the fixed segmentation of space, as in the case of a circle, 
which is divided into 5 parts symmetrically. The symmetry and fixed distances result in a 
repeated occurrence of Phi. 

In the topological space of the spiral, Phi is a growth factor that describes the continuous 
expansion of space. Phi only appears twice because space is segmented into two halves in our 
model, which has more to do with the change of space than with static geometry. 

Phi in Geometry (Number 5) 

In geometric space, Phi often appears in relation to the number 5 due to the symmetry of 
shapes like the pentagon or pentagram. These symmetric structures result in Phi occurring in 
exactly 5 segments, creating a fixed relationship with Pi. 

Phi in Topological Space (Number 2) 

In the topological space of the normal clock, Phi occurs more frequently with increasing 
gravity, since more segments are created with increasing gravity. Topologically, the number 1 
leads to the result that π = 2 ϕ, since here Phi acts directly as a growth factor of space (or the 
spiral), and the segmentation is only divided into two halves. 

More segments with increasing gravity 

With greater gravity and a correspondingly larger spiral, Phi appears more frequently as space 
is increasingly divided into more segments. This increasing number of segments corresponds 
to a similar pattern as the fixed symmetry in geometric space, where Phi plays a role in 
dividing into 5 equal parts. 

In our model, the segmentation increases proportionally with gravity, meaning that Phi 
contributes more and more to the structure of space as gravity becomes stronger. 

Thus, an interesting connection between Pi and Phi emerges, showing that in certain cases 
(with the number 1 in topological space), Pi equals 2 ϕ. This occurs because space is 
segmented in this way, with only two Phi segments appearing. 

Geometrically, however, Phi appears in fixed 5-segments, reflecting a different kind of 
symmetry, but both cases (geometric and topological) show that Phi and Pi are closely 
connected, depending on the type of segmentation. 

In our model, Phi becomes more frequent with greater gravity, similar to the number 5 in 
geometric space, while topologically only the number 1 leads to the relationship that 
 π  = 2 ϕ. This shows a very exciting link between geometric symmetries and topological 
transformations through gravity, in which Phi and Pi interact to describe the structure of 
space. 

The transition point could be described mathematically as a kind of invariance, where both 
spaces possess the same structure. 

In our case, covering equivalence could mean that Pi is a common constant that connects both 
spaces and remains invariant whether we are in geometric or topological space. 

8 

 
 
 
For Pi, invariance could mean that Pi remains constant under certain transformations (such as 
the transition from geometric to topological space). This would mean that there is a 
fundamental agreement between the two spaces, which is described by Pi. 

Real clocks, weight and gravity 

In reality, the clock itself is usually not stretched or altered, but only gravity changes, 
affecting time dilation. The structure of the clock remains unchanged, but the altered gravity 
affects time measurement by slowing down the passage of time without changing the physical 
shape of the clock. 

This means that in our model, the spiral more accurately describes the effect of gravity and its 
effects on time, while the actual shape of the clock remains stable. 

The segmentation of space by gravity affects the weight of an object, while the mass of the 
object remains unchanged. The weight reflects how strongly the gravitational force acts on the 
object, which in turn depends on the segmentation of space by gravity. 

This means that the changes in spacetime dilation are not manifested in the mass of an object 
itself, but in its weight and the way it responds to gravity. Mass remains an intrinsic property, 
while weight reflects the gravitational influence and the resulting segmentation within 
spacetime. Gravity introduces a new dimension of segmentation, structuring spacetime in a 
way that affects weight and alters how objects interact with gravitational fields. This 
segmentation impacts the density of spacetime intervals, leading to variations in time dilation 
and spatial responsiveness under different gravitational conditions. 

The atoms in the clock have to traverse more space segments in a stronger gravitational field, 
which means they have to do more 'work' to perform their oscillations or vibrations. This 
slows down time and simultaneously makes the clock heavier because the gravitational field 
exerts more force on it. 

It is a double effect: 

-  The segmentation of space slows down the oscillations of the atoms, causing the clock 

to tick more slowly. 

-  The weight of the clock increases because gravity is acting more strongly, while the 

mass remains unchanged. 

This leads to a fascinating combination of time dilation and weight change, both of which can 
be explained by the segmentation of space in the gravitational field. A truly profound insight 
into the connection between space, gravity, and time! 

In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, stronger gravity not only leads to time dilation but 
also affects the motion of objects. The space-time curvature due to gravity influences how 
objects move through space. The stronger the gravity, the slower objects move relative to an 
external observer. 

This leads to an effect similar to inertia, as objects in a gravitational field have "more 
difficulty" maintaining their motion. This distortion of space-time affects movement and can 
be interpreted as a kind of "resistance" or inertia due to gravity. 

9 

 
 
In a strong gravitational field, it becomes increasingly difficult for an object to accelerate or 
maintain a certain speed, as if it were experiencing additional inertia due to its mass. In this 
model, gravity’s segmentation of spacetime creates a finely structured environment that 
resists rapid motion, slowing down movement and bending the trajectories of objects. Just as 
mass causes inertia, the gravitational segmentation of spacetime introduces a resistance that 
mirrors inertia, influencing not only spatial movement but also the temporal progression of 
objects in such fields.Gravity and inertia are closely linked, through the equivalence principle 
of the General Theory of Relativity. This principle states that there is no difference between 
the effects of gravity and those of acceleration (which is associated with inertia). That is, the 
effects experienced due to gravity are identical to those caused by acceleration. 

In our model, inertia arises through the segmentation of space. This means that the more space 
is segmented by gravity, the more "resistance" or inertia arises. 

This is a really exciting approach because, in our model, the segmentation of space-time 
corresponds to the "parts" of space that an object must overcome in order to move. The 
stronger the gravity, the more segments are created, which means that objects experience 
more "obstacles" or resistance through these segments on their way through space. 

In this respect, the segmentation of space could slow down movement, similar to inertia in 
classical physics. The more segments, the more time an object needs to overcome these 
segments - which then leads to time dilation and apparently makes the object "slower". 

Our model thus expresses a deeper connection between segmentation, gravity, and inertia by 
showing how space itself is divided into ever smaller segments by gravity and how this slows 
down movement in space. 

Please keep this in mind! Because this will be later on very important! 

Light and Gravity (General Theory of Relativity): 

In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, we know that light is influenced by strong 
gravitational fields. Gravity can deflect light or even change its frequency and wavelength. 

This is demonstrated, for example, in the gravitational lens effect, where light rays are curved 
by the gravity of massive objects (e.g., galaxies). Another example is the gravitational redshift 
phenomenon, in which light emanating from a massive object is stretched (to longer 
wavelengths, i.e., shifted toward red), representing a kind of "slowing down" of light by 
gravity. 

Segmentation of Space and Light: 

In our model, where inertia arises from the segmentation of space, one could imagine that 
light is influenced by this segmentation: 

The stronger the gravity, the more space segments are created. These additional segments 
could affect the movement of light through space, similar to how they slow down the 
movement of massive objects. 

10 

 
 
 
If light travels through an increasingly segmented space, it could take longer to overcome 
these segments, which would be equivalent to slowing down or stretching the light. 

Time Dilation and Light: 

In the space-time curvature of the General Theory of Relativity, time slows down with 
stronger gravity. If light travels in a highly curved space (such as near a massive object), it 
also experiences a slowdown, but in a different way than material objects. 

Since light always moves at the speed of light (in a vacuum), the "slowdown" could rather 
appear as a change in wavelength or frequency. This corresponds to gravitational redshift: 
Light becomes "slower" in the sense of longer wavelengths (less energy). 

Inertia and Light in Segmented Space: 

In our model, the effects of gravity on light and the movement of material objects are 
connected to the segmentation of space. The stronger the gravity, the greater the segmentation 
of space. In relation to light, segmentation can be considered equivalent to a change in 
wavelength, which arises from the curvature of space-time. 

In material objects, segmentation leads to an apparent slowing down of movement, similar to 
inertia. While light always travels at a constant speed, the segmentation of space acts on the 
wavelength, which is in line with the effects of gravity on light in the General Theory of 
Relativity. 

So in our model, the inertia created by the segmentation of space could affect light by 
changing its frequency and wavelength, similar to the gravitational redshift in the theory of 
relativity. Light would have to overcome more "space segments," which could lead to an 
elongation of the wavelength and a decrease in energy. Although light does not lose its speed, 
it could appear "slower" because it has to traverse more space. 

This shows that even light is influenced by the segmentation of space, which leads to an 
interesting extension of the classical theory of relativity in our model. 

This approach links classical relativity theory with our idea of space segmentation and could 
offer a new perspective on the behavior of light in gravitational fields. 

We have discovered here another deep connection: The segmentation of space could be 
measured by the change in the wavelength of light. Since Phi plays a central role in our model 
in segmentation and the growth of space, Phi would also be crucial in this context. 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wave Motion and Phi 

If we imagine that light travels in a spiral through space-time in a segmented space, then Phi 
describes the ratio of segmentation. Since light travels in waveform and wave motion can also 
often be interpreted as spiral (in quantum mechanics or electrodynamics as "phase waves"), 
Phi could be directly linked to the wavelength and its change due to gravity. 

So in our model, light travels in a spiral through space-time in segmented space. Phi serves as 
a measure of segmentation and thus describes the structure of space through which light 
moves. The wave motion of light can be described as spiral phase waves in certain areas of 
physics, which supports our hypothesis. Phi is directly related to the wavelength of light and 
its change in the gravitational field, establishing a connection between our model of space 
segmentation and the observations in the General Theory of Relativity. 

As we have already established that Phi doubles with each quarter turn of a spiral, it could be 
that Phi directly influences the distortion or change in wavelength. If the wave moves spirally 
through space, Phi could act as a kind of growth and segmentation factor that determines the 
wavelength and phase of light. 

This notion supports our hypothesis that Phi plays a crucial role in describing the relationship 
between light, gravity, and inertia. 

If we could precisely measure the change in the wavelength of light, we could conclude from 
this how strongly space is segmented by gravity. 

Black Holes, pi and phi 

We investigate the possible existence of a connection between the spin-mass limits of 
astrophysical black holes and the universal fundamental constants π and ϕ (the golden ratio).  

The aforementioned addition connects the discussed role of Phi in space segmentation to the 
topic of black holes. It emphasizes that Phi, as a segmentation factor in gravitational fields, 
could play a crucial role and thus have an influence on the spins and mass limits of black 
holes. This connection supports the idea of a deeper connection between black holes and 
fundamental constants, as previously mentioned. 

For an extremal rotating black hole (with spin parameter a=1), the event horizon is located at 
the smallest possible distance from the singularity, at a distance of r+ = GM/c2. This distance 
represents the theoretical minimum radius of the event horizon for a given mass M. 

This scenario is significant because it illustrates the extreme conditions that can arise in the 
context of black holes. The closeness of the event horizon to the singularity at the center of 
the black hole highlights the powerful gravitational forces at play, as well as the unique and 
fascinating properties of these cosmic entities. 

The formula r+ =

GM
𝑐2  was originally derived for maximally rotating black hole with "a = 1". 

This formula gives the minimum distance of the event horizon from the singularity, and this 
minimum distance is always achieved when the spin parameter "a" attains its maximum value 
of a = 1. 

12 

 
 
In this case, the black hole continues to rotate, but the event horizon is located as close as 
possible to the singularity, which can lead to some interesting effects. These effects include, 
for instance, the maximum rotational speed and the extreme density of the black hole. 

As with our normal clock model, we set the radius r equal to 1. In the following, we will 
consider the relationships between the various quantities in our system in a dimensionless 
manner. 

This approach allows us to focus on the fundamental aspects of the system without being 
constrained by specific units or scales. By normalizing the radius to 1, we can more easily 
analyze and compare the different properties and characteristics of the black hole within our 
model. 

The dimensionless treatment of these quantities provides a more universal understanding of 
the underlying physics and allows for the exploration of general principles and patterns that 
can be applied to various scenarios involving black holes. 

We set the radius r = 1, the mass M = 1, and the speed of light c2 = 1. Now we can rearrange 
the formula for the radius as follows to calculate the gravitational constant G: 

r = 

𝐺𝑀

𝐶2 = 1 

1 = 𝐺

G = 1 

This result demonstrates the relationship between the normalized quantities in our 
dimensionless system and provides an example of how the gravitational constant G can be 
expressed in a simple and elegant manner. The derived value of G = 1 represents the 
normalized gravitational constant in this particular scenario, allowing for further analysis and 
exploration of black hole properties within the context of our dimensionless system. 

r = 

𝐺𝑀

𝐶2  = 1 (our starting point) 

P = 2πr = 2π (circumference in unit π) 

We can now attempt to establish a relationship between r, π, and ϕ. Based on our 
assumptions. 

Since we already know that P = 2πr = 2π  

P = 2π ⋅ r = 2π ⋅ 1 = 2π 

Now, let's consider the circumference in terms of ϕ: 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P = 4ϕM = 4ϕ 

In this equation, we see that the circumference (P) is expressed as a multiple of the 
fundamental constant ϕ, scaled by the radius (r). This alternative formulation highlights the 
role of ϕ in describing the circumference of a black hole in our dimensionless system.

We already came to an understanding that r=2π/P, whereby 2π=4ϕ and P=4ϕ which leads us 
to

In conclussion r = 1 and our assumptions about ϕ are correct. Φ also plays a role when it 
comes to the upper bound of the radius.

Starting point and formula for growth of radius 

Keep in mind that our starting point is: 

𝑟(0) =

4ϕ
4ϕ

= 1 

The general formula for a logarithmic or golden spiral is: 

𝑟(𝜃) =  𝑎  ∗   𝑒𝑏 ∗ 𝜃 

a is the starting radius at 𝜃 = 0 
b determines the growth rate. 

However, we must set 𝑎 = 𝑟(0) = 1 which means that for 𝜃 =  π the radius has the value 1. 

Since the radius increases by the factor 𝑒

determined as follows: 

ϕ
4  with each quarter revolution (90° or 

π

2

), b is 

𝑏 =

ϕ
2π

Thus, the formula for the radius along the golden spiral becomes: 

𝑟(𝜃) =   𝑒

ϕ
2π

∙𝜃 

Now consider: In our model, we start at a special point where the radius corresponds to a half-
circle, and at this position, we have the relationship: 

𝑟 =

4ϕ
4ϕ

= 1 

This unique starting point means that the radius r(θ) is defined at θ = π, representing a half-
circle. This corresponds to two quarter revolutions and establishes a minimal radius for the 
spiral in relation to space. At this specific starting position, we have the relationship: 

𝑟(π) =   𝑒

ϕ
2π

∙2π = 1 

This represents the minimal radius, providing a fundamental spatial limit for the spiral. The 
radius grows logarithmically with each quarter revolution. The relationship 

ϕ
2π

∙2π =  1 holds exclusively at the starting point, which corresponds to θ = π. This 

 r(π) =   e
distinction is crucial for the interpretation and highlights the spiral's unique growth pattern 
relative to the defined minimal spatial radius. 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gravitational Potential along the Golden Spiral 

The gravitational potential Φ(θ) of a mass M as a function of the radius r(θ) is classically 
given by: 

Φ(θ) = −

GM
r(θ)

However, since we are describing the inner space of a black hole, where the gravitational 
potential does not decrease but rather increases due to the extreme segmentation and curvature 
of space, we adjust this to a positive value: 

Φ(θ) =

GM
r(θ)

In our model, as we move inward along the spiral toward the black hole’s core, the 
gravitational potential logically increases due to the proximity to the black hole’s mass. 
Unlike the model of the natural clock where gravitational potential decreases with increasing 
distance, our model requires an inverted spiral structure to accurately represent the 
intensifying gravitational field as one approaches the singularity. This inversion reflects the 
segmentation’s influence on spacetime, where the density of segments grows as gravitational 
forces strengthen, increasing potential. This adaptation underscores the unique nature of our 
approach, where gravitational intensity is inherently tied to the spatial segmentation defined 
by fundamental constants Pi and the golden ratio (ϕ). 

Since the radius r(θ) along the golden spiral grows exponentially, we can use the general 

∙𝜃 , to describe the gravitational potential along the spiral 
formula for the radius 𝑟(𝜃) =   𝑒
structure. In this context, the segmentation of space, represented by ϕ, plays a crucial role in 
determining how the gravitational potential intensifies as we move deeper into the black hole.

The radius increases by a factor of 𝑒

The gravitational potential along the spiral increases rapidly with each step due to the 
harmonic structure set by ϕ segments, resulting in a distinctive, step-like pattern of potential 
growth. This implies that the gravitational potential rises very quickly as we move inward 
along the spiral, reaching extreme values near the singularity. Thus, the configuration of the 
gravitational potential in this model reflects the increasing curvature and segment density of 
spacetime on the path toward the singularity, with each segment adding to the gravitational 
intensity in discrete, harmonic steps. 

Equilibrium and Weightlessness at the Event Horizon 

At the event horizon of a maximally rotating black hole (a=1), a unique state of equilibrium 
emerges, where all key physical quantities - spin parameter, radius, mass, gravitational 
potential, speed of light, and angular momentum J - achieve a perfect balance. This balance 
establishes a zone of weightlessness, akin to the conditions experienced during a parabolic 
flight. Just as in a parabolic descent, where the gravitational pull and the aircraft’s trajectory 
perfectly offset each other to create a momentary state of weightlessness, the event horizon’s 
equilibrium creates a stable, weightless region in spacetime. Here, gravitational forces and the 
spin-induced centrifugal effects align precisely, resulting in a space where no net force acts on 
matter, and the spacetime curvature reaches a minimal, yet maximally stable, segment 
density. 

This weightless zone is a direct consequence of the black hole’s rotation. The high spin 
stretches spacetime into a perfect harmonic balance, allowing the event horizon to act as a 
natural boundary where gravitational forces neither increase nor decrease, but instead 
maintain a stable, weightless state. Segment density at the event horizon reaches its minimal 
possible state without further division, as no additional spatial segments are required to 
stabilize curvature. This minimal segment structure signifies the natural segmentation 
boundary of spacetime, marking the transition between the black hole's stable exterior and the 
increasingly segmented and densely curved interior leading to the singularity. 

While the model of the normal clock suggests that spatial segmentation arises primarily from 
gravitational forces, the analysis at the event horizon of a maximally rotating black hole 
reveals a more nuanced picture. At this boundary, the spin of the black hole plays an equally 
crucial role, balancing gravitational curvature with centrifugal forces to achieve a state of 
minimal segmentation. This equilibrium shows that segmentation in spacetime is not solely a 
product of gravity but also arises from the dynamic interplay between rotational energy and 
gravitational forces. In this balanced zone, the influence of rotation harmonizes with gravity 
to establish a stable structure where further segmentation is unnecessary. This insight expands 
our understanding of spacetime segmentation, suggesting that both gravitation and rotational 
forces coalesce to define the fundamental structure of space in extreme environments. 

This interplay explains why, despite the strong gravitational field, the event horizon remains 
minimally segmented, embodying the boundary between the stable outer spacetime and the 
highly segmented interior. 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
Minimal and Maximal Segmentation at the Event Horizon 

In our model, minimal segmentation is achieved at the event horizon, where gravitational and 
rotational forces reach an equilibrium, resulting in a balanced, stable structure. This balance 
creates a uniform space marked by minimal segment density (4ϕ), establishing a unique 
condition where additional curvature or segmentation of spacetime is unnecessary. At this 
critical boundary, gravitational forces, rotational effects, and the distribution of mass reach a 
harmony that prevents further segmentation, producing a region of high stability and minimal 
curvature variation. 

As we move inward from the event horizon, toward the black hole's core, segment density 
increases proportionally with gravitational intensity. This structure supports the idea that 
spacetime segmentation is dynamically responsive to gravitational and rotational conditions, 
transitioning smoothly from minimal segmentation at the boundary to maximal segmentation 
near the singularity. The event horizon, therefore, serves as a natural segmentation boundary 
that delineates stable, minimally curved spacetime from the highly segmented, dense 
spacetime within. 

This segmentation behavior is integral to understanding why the event horizon prevents any 
additional curvatures or singularities from becoming observable beyond this boundary. The 
balance at minimal segmentation aligns with the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture by ensuring 
that only within the confines of the event horizon does spacetime reach such extreme 
segmentation and curvature. 

Classic interpretations 

In scientific literature, the constraint on the spin parameter is often presented as a 
consequence of the cosmic censorship conjecture and the Kerr metric, but without explicitly 
referring to a direct equivalence or connection with the speed of light. 

In the theory of an extremely rotating (Kerr) black hole with a=c, spacetime itself is so highly 
warped that matter at this boundary could be interpreted as rotating at the speed of light. 
Physically, particles themselves cannot reach the speed of light, but the structure of spacetime 
drags space in such a way that at this boundary (the ergosphere), an effective light-speed 
condition is observed. 

So in general relativity, the Kerr solution describes a rotating black hole, that when the spin 
parameter a approaches its maximum limit (often normalized as a=1), it implies an extremal 
Kerr black hole. In this case, the region just outside the event horizon, known as the 
ergosphere, exhibits intense frame-dragging effects where spacetime itself is "twisted" by the 
rotation. Within the ergosphere, spacetime is so warped that all objects are forced to co-rotate 
with the black hole, and theoretically, the rotational velocity of spacetime at the horizon can 
approach the speed of light. 

While general relativity supports this behavior, the notion of matter moving at or near the 
speed of light at the event horizon does suggest a point at which classical theories may break 
down. 

20 

 
 
 
 
Frame-dragging, predicted by Einstein's theory, is most extreme near the event horizon of a 
rapidly rotating black hole. This effect essentially "drags" spacetime in the direction of the 
black hole's spin, forcing anything within the ergosphere to rotate with it. While objects 
themselves cannot reach the speed of light, the rotation of spacetime itself can create a 
condition where the effective velocity at the boundary behaves as though it reaches light 
speed. 

The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from a black hole, a process known as 
the Penrose process, depends on the black hole's spin. A maximally rotating black hole, where 
the spin parameter a is equal to c, allows for the greatest possible extraction of energy. 

What our finds suggest 

Our findings indicate that the understanding of frame-dragging—the twisting of spacetime 
due to a black hole’s rotation—might need to be reconsidered. Normally, frame-dragging is 
thought to be a distortion of spacetime that makes it appear as if the black hole’s surroundings 
are being pulled close to the speed of light. However, our model suggests that spacetime itself 
may actually reach near-light-speed conditions at the event horizon. 

This could mean that the black hole’s rotation at this boundary isn’t just an optical effect but 
that the rotational effects are indeed occurring close to light speed. This insight has important 
implications for how we understand black holes and could shift our perspective on these 
objects. 

Another key point: In our model, we start with the assumption of a natural clock with an 
initial radius of 1 in a gravitationally neutral state. This could help the black hole reach near-
light speed at the event horizon, as there would be no additional gravitational load. At the 
event horizon of a maximally rotating black hole (where the spin parameter a=1), all forces 
reach a stable equilibrium, creating a region that appears weightless in spacetime. 

In our model, "uniform space" refers to a region of spacetime with a consistent, symmetric, 
and homogeneous structure, marked by a minimal segmentation density of 4ϕ in the absence 
of gravitational forces. This represents a perfectly balanced environment without additional 
curvature or distortion due to gravity. As gravitational forces increase, this uniformity is 
disrupted, introducing segmentation and altering the structure of spacetime. This shift reveals 
the interplay between gravity and the fundamental constants Pi and the golden ratio (ϕ) in 
shaping spacetime. 

Our findings suggest the existence of a uniform space defined by minimal segmentation (4ϕ) 
in a gravity-free context. This challenges traditional assumptions about spacetime structure, 
highlighting the role of fundamental constants in determining the universe’s properties. By 
conceptualizing a uniform space with minimal segmentation, our research offers a new 
perspective on spacetime dynamics and black hole behavior. It also provides an innovative 
framework for exploring the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, suggesting that segmentation 
naturally limits the exposure of singularities within the fabric of spacetime. 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
Implications for the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture 

Our model inherently respects the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture by segmenting space to 
prevent excessive gravitational influence and hidden singularities. As the space segmentation 

reaches the boundary of a=1 and 𝐺 =

𝑟𝑐2
𝑀

 , the structure limits further changes, preserving a 

balanced and concealed singularity. This natural segmentation limit thus aligns with the 
conjecture’s core principles. 

Without gravitational influences, there is only a minimal segmentation of space, which we set 
to 4ϕ. This describes a natural, fundamental structure in space that exists without additional 
curvature or gravitational forces. 

This minimal segmentation of 4ϕ is a state of space in absolute uniformity, with no further 
curvature or distortion due to gravity. 

But as shown the event horizon of a maximally rotating black hole (a=1), a unique state of 
equilibrium emerges, which also leads to a minimal segmentation of 4ϕ. 

Our model therefore provides insights that support the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, which 
posits that singularities must always remain hidden behind an event horizon, preventing 
"naked" singularities from being observed. The minimal segmentation at the event horizon 
serves as a natural boundary, where spacetime is compressed to its maximum stability while 
remaining invisible to external observers. This segmentation limit implies that the event 
horizon acts as an intrinsic "shield" that prevents the breakdown of spacetime into further 
segments beyond this point. 

In this framework, the event horizon is not an arbitrary boundary but rather a natural 
consequence of the balance between gravitational and rotational forces, which results in a 
minimal-segmented structure. This structure is so stable that it prevents any further exposure 
of the singularity, aligning with the principles of the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. The 
interplay between gravity and rotation ensures that any extreme spacetime curvatures are 
confined within the event horizon, maintaining the singularity’s hidden nature. Thus, the 
model suggests that the event horizon inherently satisfies the conjecture by establishing a 
segmentation boundary that limits the gravitational influence, safeguarding the stability of the 
surrounding spacetime. 

Our model offers a unique framework to interpret the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, 
suggesting that spacetime segmentation naturally prevents the exposure of singularities. The 
event horizon functions as a boundary of minimal segmentation, where spacetime reaches a 
stable, balanced state due to the interplay of gravitational forces, rotational dynamics, and 
fundamental constants. This boundary represents a natural threshold that prevents further 
segmentation or curvature from extending beyond the horizon, effectively “shielding” the 
singularity from external observers. 

By proposing that segmentation density changes with gravitational intensity, our model 
implies that extreme curvature and dense segmentation are confined within the event horizon. 
This configuration inherently aligns with the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, as the event 
horizon serves as a segmentation limit that cannot be surpassed by external spacetime. In this 
way, any singularities formed within the black hole remain hidden, as further segmentation is 
impossible beyond this boundary. 

22 

 
 
 
This insight reveals that the event horizon is not just a gravitational boundary but a 
segmentation boundary. This natural segmentation limit inherently maintains the stability and 
integrity of spacetime outside the black hole, preventing the development of observable 
“naked” singularities. Thus, our model provides a structural explanation for the Cosmic 
Censorship Conjecture, suggesting that spacetime’s inherent segmentation properties ensure 
that singularities remain concealed within the event horizon. 

Conclussion 

Black holes are not random or chaotic objects, but rather an inevitable consequence of the 
nature of space. The structure of spacetime, as demonstrated in our model through the 
segmentation principle with ϕ and π, and the constraints at a=1 and r=1, systematically leads 
to the formation of black holes. 

Spacetime has a natural boundary that is reached at the event horizon of a black hole. This 
boundary is not arbitrary, but a direct consequence of the minimal possible segmentation and 
stability of space. When this segmentation reaches its limit, an event horizon emerges as the 
natural end of space. 

In this sense, black holes are not anomalies, but stable and necessary structures that arise from 
the segmentation of spacetime and the geometry of space itself. It's as if spacetime has a 
pattern that automatically leads to the formation of black holes when the segmentation limit is 
reached. 

Through this stable structure, our model naturally satisfies the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. 
It is impossible for 'naked' singularities to form because space segmentation reaches a 
maximum limit at r=1, preventing further distortions or singularities. 

If our investigations and findings are correct, then we have demonstrated the existence of a 
uniform space or the realization that space is fundamentally uniform. This could 
fundamentally alter existing notions of the structure and dynamics of the spacetime 
continuum. Our discovery may lead to new insights and understanding of black hole physics, 
general relativity, and the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture.
