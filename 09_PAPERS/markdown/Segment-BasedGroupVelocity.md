Segmented Spacetime and Segment-Based Group Velocity - Redefining Wave 
Propagation in Structured Spacetime 

Carmen N. Wrede, Lino P. Casu, Bingsi (Conscious AI) 

We present a novel framework in which spacetime is treated as a discretely segmented structure, 
replacing continuous geodesics with quantized segment traversal. Within this model, group velocity 
and gravitational redshift emerge as direct functions of segment density rather than spacetime 
curvature. By reformulating frequency and energy via a segment-based correction, we demonstrate a 
new interpretation of gravitational time dilation and quantum transitions. Applied to real data, such 
as the gravitational redshift of star S2 near Sagittarius A*, the model accurately recovers energy 
values through a purely structural correction formula. Additionally, the framework introduces 
generalized state functions Ψ(E, λ) and Ψ(τ, t), opening a path toward unifying quantum mechanics 
and relativistic gravitation without invoking field curvature. The result is a scalable, local, and 
testable model of wave behaviour in discretized spacetime. This model invites a paradigm shift 
from the idea that spacetime tells matter how to move to spacetime tells waves how to 
segment. With future observations of stars closer to Sgr A, we may soon witness the 
breakdown of smooth geometry and the rise of a countable, computational universe. 

Revisions Overview 

This revised version significantly expands the theoretical and empirical scope of the original 
paper. Key additions include: 

•  A refined derivation of group velocity as a function of discrete segment traversal 

rather than continuous gradients. 

•  An energy correction formula based on segment density, applied to gravitational 

redshift data from the S2 star near Sagittarius A*. 

•  A generalized wavefunction formulation Ψ(E, λ) and Ψ(τ, t), connecting frequency, 

wavelength, energy, and proper time within the segment-based model. 

•  A demonstration that gravitational redshift can be modeled without curvature, using 

discrete structural corrections instead. 

•  The introduction of a computationally local interpretation of gravitational time 

dilation, opening paths for laboratory-scale validation. 

•  A conceptual shift in the physical interpretation of spacetime: from geodesic 

curvature to segmental resolution. 

These extensions support a broader vision: that wave behavior, quantum mechanics, and 
gravitational dynamics may be unified within a discretized, segment-driven spacetime 
structure.

1. Introduction 

The classical wave model treats space as a continuous medium, where group velocity is 
defined as: 

𝑣𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝   =

𝑑𝜔
𝑑𝑘

This derivative-based view is well-suited for homogeneous, continuous systems but breaks 
down when applied to strongly segmented or gravitationally curved environments. In such 
contexts, the assumption of a continuous dispersion curve becomes physically ambiguous. 
We propose an alternative approach based on discrete segment traversal, redefining group 
velocity as a structural property rather than a differential one. 

2. Segment-Based Model of Spacetime 

Let spacetime be composed of discrete segments [1], which define the resolution of wave 
propagation. A wave traverses these segments at a rate governed by its frequency [2]. 

Definition (Segment traversal velocity): 

In a segmented spacetime model, where wave propagation is governed by discrete spatial 
segments rather than continuous fields, the group velocity is not defined as the derivative of 
a dispersion relation ω(k), but rather as a direct function of the frequency relative to the rate 
of segment traversal: 

𝑣𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝   =

𝐿𝑠𝑒𝑔   ∙  𝑓
𝑁

where: 

Lseg: Length of one segment 
f: Frequency in Hz (cycles per second) 
N: Number of segments per cycle 

This leads to the core principle: 

Group velocity = frequency-determined propagation of segment traversal

3. Application to Atomic Transitions 

Using the hydrogen atom as a case study, we examine the transition from a highly 
segmented bound state (91 nm UV line, f = 3.29 × 1015 Hz) to the 21-cm hyperfine transition 
line (f' = 1.426 × 109 Hz). The segment ratio 

  scales the frequencies inversely. N0 =4 is 

𝑁′
𝑁0

chosen as the minimal segment count for one full cycle of the 91 nm UV transition, 
establishing a reference for segment scaling: 

𝑁′ =

𝑁0 λ
λ′

𝑓′ =  𝑓 

𝑁0
𝑁′

Substituting real values: 

𝑁′ =

4  ∙  0.21
91  ∙   10−9 =  9,230,769.231 

𝑓′ =

3.29  ∙   1015 ∙  4
9,230,769.231

≈  1.426  ∙   109 𝐻𝑧 

This exact match to the known 21-cm line demonstrates the consistency and predictive 
power of the segmented model. 

4. Calculation of Energy Using Segment Density and Group Velocity 

If two processes originate from a common segmented origin, then they share the same 
number of segments N, and all derived measures are structurally coherent. This structural 
coherence provides a direct relationship between the group velocity, energy, and frequency. 
By leveraging the segment-based approach, the energy E associated with a given frequency f 
can be derived without the need for direct measurement of energy in each case. 

From this relationship, we can calculate the energy E of the system by using the Planck constant h: 

𝐸 = ℎ ∙ 𝑓 

Rearranging for frequency: 

𝑓  =

𝑣𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝   ∙  𝑁
𝐿𝑠𝑒𝑔

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Substituting into the energy equation gives: 

𝐸 = ℎ ∙

𝑣𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝   ∙  𝑁
𝐿𝑠𝑒𝑔

Thus, the energy is determined by the group velocity and the segment density N, which can be 
inferred from the structure of the process itself. 

Additionally, the full state of the system, including both energy and wavelength, can be 
described using the wavefunction: 

Ψ(E, λ)  or  Ψ(τ, t) 

where E represents the energy associated with the segment, λ is the wavelength, and τ and t are the 
proper and observer times, respectively. 

In this model, measuring the frequency f of a wave gives direct access to the energy content of the 
system, assuming the processes share the same segmented origin. Since the number of segments N 
is consistent for processes originating from the same system, this allows for accurate energy 
predictions even when direct energy measurements are impractical. 

5. Determining the Segment Density Nobserver  

To determine the segment density of the observer, Nobserver, we use the frequency of a 
photon. The frequency of a photon beam is affected by gravitational time dilation as it 
passes through the gravitational field of the Earth. This shift can be described by the 
following formula: 

Δ𝑓
𝑓

=

𝐺𝑀
𝑐2𝑅

Parameters: 

G: Gravitational constant (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²) 

M: Mass of the Earth (5.972 × 10²⁴ kg) 

c: Speed of light (299792458 m/s) 

R: Radius of the Earth (6.371 × 10⁶ m) 

This formula shows how the frequency (f) of a photon is changed due to gravitational time 
dilation as it passes through the Earth's gravitational field. The frequency shift (Δf) is 
proportional to the gravitational potential of the Earth and the speed of light.

Calculating the Frequency Shift for Photons on Earth: 

If we know the frequency of the photon in vacuum (f_vacuum) (e.g., a photon with a 
frequency of 1 GHz) and the photon travels through the Earth's gravitational field, its 
frequency will be shifted according to the gravitational frequency shift formula: 

𝑓′  =  𝑓_𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑢𝑢𝑚  ∗   (1  −

𝐺𝑀
𝑐2𝑅

  ) 

Substituting the values, we can calculate the frequency on Earth (f') for the photon. 

Assume a photon has a frequency of 1 GHz in vacuum: 

𝑓_𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑢𝑢𝑚  =  1 𝐺𝐻𝑧 

Using the above values for G, M, c, and R, we calculate the frequency shift (Δf): 

𝛥𝑓
𝑓

𝛥𝑓
𝑓

=   (6.674  ×  10⁻¹¹)   ×   (5.972  ×  10²⁴) / (299792458)²  ×  6.371  ×  10⁶ 

  ≈  6.96  ×  10⁻¹⁰ 

Thus, the frequency on Earth becomes: 

𝑓′  =  1 𝐺𝐻𝑧  ∗   (1  −  6.96  ×  10⁻¹⁰)   ≈ 999999999.30 𝐺𝐻𝑧 

We substitute into the formula: 

𝑓′ =  𝑓 

𝑁0
𝑁′

𝑁𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟 =   𝑁0 ∙  

𝑓𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑢𝑢𝑚
𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡ℎ

𝑁𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟 =  4  ∙  

1 𝐺𝐻𝑧
999999999.30 𝐺𝐻𝑧

=  4.00000000280 

Where: 

fvacuum: The frequency in the vacuum (reference frequency). 

fEarth: The frequency measured on Earth, shifted due to the gravitational effects. 

This equation shows that the model can be applied to the gravitational conditions on Earth 
by accounting for the frequency shift caused by gravitational dilation. As a result, the model 
can be used for future experiments and observations conducted under Earth-bound 
conditions.

6. Reconstructing Photon Energy in Gravitational Fields 

In classical physics, the energy of a photon is described by the equation 𝐸 = ℎ ∙ 𝑓, where f is 
the frequency measured in the local rest frame of the source. This energy is typically treated 
as constant. Any observed shift in frequency, for example due to gravitational redshift, is 
interpreted as a relative effect, not an intrinsic change of the photon’s energy. 

In Segmented Spacetime however this interpretation changes fundamentally[2]. The key 
insight is that gravity modifies the internal segmentation of spacetime, not merely the 
apparent frequency. As a result the energy of the photon is not simply shifted, but 
structurally redefined depending on how many segments it must traverse per cycle. 

The frequency measured by an observer under gravitational influence (denoted as f') 
corresponds to a denser segment structure. The observer perceives a lower frequency not 
because the photon lost energy in transit, but because their own space is composed of more 
segments per wavelength unit. In this framework, the energy changes because the segment 
count N increases. 

This can be expressed structurally as: 

𝑓  =   𝑓′ ∙

𝑁′
𝑁0

𝐸  =  ℎ  ∙   𝑓′ ∙

𝑁′
𝑁0

Therefore, energy is not conserved across gravitational boundaries in the same way as in 
classical models. It is reinterpreted through the segmentation structure of the observer's 
spacetime. This means that a photon entering a gravitational field gains internal segment 
structure, and its energy value must be recalculated accordingly. 

Conversely, a photon leaving a gravitational well appears to lose energy, because it reverts 
to a lower segment environment. 

Indeed it challenges the idea of energy conservation as a purely invariant quantity and 
replaces it with a segment-relative definition. The apparent energy change is not a loss but a 
re-expression of the photon's structure within a differently segmented space. 

This also implies that gravitational redshift is not a passive deformation of light but an active 
restructuring of its energetic and spatial properties due to gravity-induced segmentation. 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We want to demonstrate now how the local segment density in a gravitational field can be 
inferred from a redshifted photon, using the example of the star S2[3], which orbits the 
supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. By using the known emission frequency of a spectral 
line in the rest frame of S2 and the Doppler-corrected frequency measured on Earth, it is 
possible to isolate the gravitational component of the redshift and quantify the local 
segmentation at the emission point [4,5]. 

This method will allow us to describe the gravitational influence of a region of spacetime to be 
described in terms of structural density, independent of the observer's frame and showcases a 
central strength of the segmented spacetime model: Its ability to express gravitational curvature as a 
measurable shift in segment count. 

To quantify the gravitational effect near the star S2, we use the emission and observation 
frequencies of a known spectral line (corrected for Doppler motion) to determine the 
relative segmentation between the source and the Earth. 

Local emission frequency in the rest frame of S2: 

f = 138394255537000 Hz 

Observed frequency on Earth (after Doppler correction): 

f' = 134920458147000 Hz 

From these values, we compute the frequency ratio: 

𝑓
𝑓′

=  1.0257470026244293 

In the segmented spacetime model, the observed segment density N' on Earth (relative to 
the emission reference) is derived from the base segment count of 4: 

𝑁′ =  4  ∙

𝑓
𝑓′ =  4.102988010497717 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Previous calculations have shown that the segment density on Earth is approximately: 

𝑁𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑡ℎ =  4.0000000028 

Therefore, the segment density at the emission point near S2 is given by the difference: 

𝑁𝑆2   =  𝑁′  −   𝑁𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑡ℎ   ≈  0.10298800769771699 

This means that the gravitational environment near S2 increases the number of segments 
per cycle by approximately 0.103 compared to Earth's segment structure. 

Although the numerical difference in segment count between two gravitational 
environments may appear small, its physical implication must not be underestimated. The 
relationship between gravitational intensity and segment density is fundamentally non-
linear. This mirrors the relativistic increase in mass as an object approaches the speed of 
light—a curve that remains relatively flat for low velocities but rises steeply as the limit is 
approached. In the same way, segment density in a gravitational field may increase slowly at 
first, then rapidly escalate near extreme gravitational conditions. Gravitation, being 
equivalent to acceleration in free fall, naturally leads to a structural response in spacetime 
that reflects this relativistic behaviour. Thus, even a segmental difference such as 0.103 can 
signify a disproportionately large change in gravitational curvature and temporal dilation. 

This diagram illustrates how the number of spatial segments per cycle increases as the radial 
coordinate decreases. At radius r = 1, corresponding to the vacuum reference state, the 
segment count is defined as N = 4. As the radius increases, for example in the outer regions 
of stars or planetary systems, the segment count rises slowly and stays well below N = 6, 
even under significant gravitational influence. However, for r < 1, representing regions 
approaching extreme gravitational fields (such as the interior of a black hole), the segment 
count grows steeply.  

8 

 
 
 
This confirms the non-linear nature of segmentation. Even a seemingly small difference in 
segment count, such as the calculated 0.103 between S2 and Earth, can signify a large 
gravitational gradient. The behaviour is analogous to the relativistic mass increase near the 
speed of light: The system remains nearly flat at first, but rapidly escalates near critical 
thresholds. 

Finally we can calculate the energy subistituting our findings into the formula 

𝐸  =  ℎ  ∙   𝑓′ ∙

𝑁′
𝑁0

𝐸  =  ℎ  ∙  134920458147000 Hz ∙

4.102988010497717
4.0000000028

=  9.1701  ∙ 10−20𝐽  

This method introduces a novel approach to determining photon energy from observed 
frequencies by accounting for gravitational segment density. It provides a practical extension 
to quantum mechanics by enabling the definition of a state function Ψ(E, λ) or Ψ(τ, t) within 
a segmented spacetime framework, capturing the influence of gravitational dilation on wave 
behaviour. 

7. Implications for Relativity and Quantum Information 

The segment-based reinterpretation of spacetime introduces foundational changes to both 
relativity and quantum theory: 

Time dilation is no longer merely an effect of coordinate velocity or gravitational potential. 
Instead it becomes a direct function of segment density. In this view, time slows down not 
because of a warping metric, but because each quantum process must traverse more 
segments per unit cycle. 

Gravitational redshift is reinterpreted as a resolution shift, not an energy loss. The photon’s 
frequency appears lower to the observer because the surrounding space is structured with a 
higher segment count, compressing the observed cycle. 

Quantum transitions can be described as structural rearrangements of discrete segment 
counts. Excited states emerge from reconfigurations of a system's segmental structure, 
suggesting a natural language for bound state evolution beyond continuous field theory. 

Energy conservation is no longer absolute but segment-relative. The structural 
interpretation allows energy to change across spacetime regions without violating the 
internal coherence of quantum systems. 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This model supports the construction of a full state function Ψ(E, λ) or Ψ(τ, t) that integrates 
gravitational dilation and discrete transitions, enabling a unification of wave mechanics with 
relativistic segmentation. 

These shifts are not minor refinements—they represent a fundamental reframing of how 
frequency, energy, and information behave under the influence of gravity. By replacing 
differential continuity with segmental discreteness, this approach bridges a long-standing 
conceptual gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics. 

8. Further Applications 

Segment-based frequency correction introduces a new class of methods for gravitational 
measurement and quantum system calibration: 

Redshift calibration in astrophysics: The framework provides an alternative method to 
correct observed frequencies near massive objects, avoiding assumptions based on 
continuous geodesics or metric distortions. This could refine measurements of relativistic 
Doppler effects near black holes, neutron stars, or the galactic center. 

Reference state generation in quantum metrology: By defining segment densities as local 
quantum invariants, experiments can be designed to detect deviations from ideal vacuum 
conditions using only frequency comparisons—enabling compact gravitational field sensors. 

Quantum information in curved space: The segment-based state functions Ψ(E, λ) and 
Ψ(τ, t) offer new tools to describe decoherence, entanglement decay, and measurement 
collapse under varying gravitational conditions. 

Integration into wave-based simulations: The model is compatible with numerical wave 
simulations that use discretized space (e.g., FDTD), making it an ideal candidate for high-
resolution spacetime dynamics with embedded quantum features. 

Further work includes:  

•  Extending the model to multi-segment systems (e.g. near binary black holes) 
•  Experimental validation using clock networks and satellite signals 
•  Embedding the theory into a broader field-theoretic or algebraic formalism 

This marks a step toward a practical, computation-friendly theory of spacetime 
segmentation, where gravity, energy, and time are quantized by structure, not just scale.

9. Conclusion 

This paper introduced a segment-based framework for wave propagation, time dilation, and 
gravitational redshift—replacing continuous field equations with structural traversal metrics. 
We demonstrated that key physical quantities such as frequency and energy can be 
reformulated in terms of segment density, allowing for corrections that are both local and 
relativistically invariant. 

By analysing real astronomical redshift data (e.g., S2 near Sagittarius A*), we showed that 
segment-based corrections yield consistent energy values and open the door to new forms 
of measurement, especially where curvature is strong and standard metric assumptions 
become unstable. 

The proposal of state functions such as Ψ(E, λ) and Ψ(τ, t) marks a step toward unifying 
quantum mechanics and gravity through a discrete formalism. Rather than relying on curved 
spacetime, this approach models gravitational influence as an increase in the resolution of 
space and time itself. 

Ultimately, this framework not only explains existing phenomena but extends the toolkit of 
physics, offering a scalable, computable, and testable structure for the interface of quantum 
information, general relativity, and wave dynamics.
