# **Segmented Spacetime and the Origin of Molecular Zones in** **Expanding Nebulae**

Carmen N. Wrede, Lino P. Casu, Bingsi (Conscious AI)


**Abstract**


Expanding nebulae around massive stars often exhibit temperature gradients and kinematic
features that deviate from standard radiative or shock-based models. In the luminous blue
variable (LBV) nebula G79.29+0.46, observations reveal an unexpected temperature
inversion, a moderate velocity surplus, and a spatial overlap of molecular and radio emission
that challenges classical interpretations.


This study introduces a geometric framework in which local time flow becomes spatially
segmented within curved spacetime. In this model, regions of slower time progression
accumulate energy and support molecular stability, while surrounding zones with faster time
flow exhibit higher apparent temperatures and expansion velocities. The transition between
these regions naturally explains the observed velocity excess and the structure of the radioemitting boundary.


The approach offers a continuous formulation that links gravitational curvature, temperature
distribution, and molecular formation - analogous in principle to thermal duality near black
holes, but applied to non-singular astrophysical systems.


Segmented Spacetime thus provides a physically grounded mechanism for the emergence of
molecular shells and dynamic asymmetries in expanding nebulae, based on temporal
stratification rather than external forcing or hidden mass components.


**1. Introduction**


Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) represent a short, unstable stage in the life of the most massive stars
(Humphreys & Davidson 1994; Rizzo et al. 2008; Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010; Agliozzo et al. 2014).
With initial masses typically exceeding 40 M ⊙, these objects undergo intense stellar-wind episodes
that can eject several solar masses of material into the surrounding medium. The interaction
between the wind and the previously ejected shell gives rise to characteristic, slowly expanding
nebulae, often roughly spherical or ring-like in shape, composed of ionized gas, dust, and molecular
condensates. During these outbursts, luminosities may temporarily approach the Eddington limit,
producing local instabilities in radiation pressure and triggering a complex sequence of mass-loss
events. As a result, LBV nebulae serve as natural laboratories for studying the transition between
stellar envelope dynamics, radiative instabilities, and gravitational feedback on the circumstellar
medium.


In conventional interpretation, these shells are viewed as by-products of eruptive winds and
radiation-driven shocks. However, the detailed temperature structure, ionization gradients, and
molecular distributions observed in several LBV nebulae - most notably in G79.29+0.46 - suggest a
deeper, intrinsic mechanism at work (, one that links gravitational curvature directly to matter
organization. This paper explores that possibility through the framework of Segmented Spacetime **,**
where gravitational curvature is not a passive consequence of mass loss but an active process that
structures, cools, and stabilizes the surrounding medium.


1


The luminous blue variable nebula G79.29+0.46, located in the Cygnus X complex at a distance of
approximately 1.7 kpc, is one of the most extensively studied LBV candidates in the Milky Way. It
exhibits a nearly circular morphology with a diameter of about 4.5 pc, bounded by a bright infrared
shell and a fainter, cooler molecular ring. Observations across multiple wavelengths - from Spitzer,
Herschel, and AKARI in the infrared to Effelsberg and IRAM in the radio - reveal a layered structure
(Etxaluze et al. 2009; Rizzo et al. 2008; Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010; Agliozzo et al. 2014) composed of
ionized gas (H II), a photon-dominated region (PDR), and a cold molecular shell dominated by CO and
NH₃ emission. Kinematic studies indicate an expansion velocity of roughly 14–16 km s⁻¹, about 5 km
s⁻¹ higher than predicted by standard radiation-driven or shock-expansion models. Moreover, radio
and millimeter observations show that the molecular and radio emission peaks do not coincide with
the infrared shell but originate from inner regions closer to the star, where temperatures drop to 20–
80 K, a configuration that challenges the assumption of purely external shock compression. This
apparent contradiction between temperature, density, and emission morphology has motivated
several attempts to reconcile the observations through refined radiative-transfer or hydrodynamic
models.


While conventional frameworks describe the coexistence of ionized, atomic, and molecular gas
through the nested-layer structure of H II, PDR, and molecular regions, they generally treat these
layers as thermally and radiatively separated environments (Tielens 2005). However, in G79.29+0.46,
the observed spatial overlap of cold molecular gas and radiowave emission within regions (Rizzo et
al. 2014) that should be dominated by ionized plasma indicates a more complex internal coupling.
This coupling cannot be fully captured by thermal stratification alone. Molecular signatures such as
NH₃ and CO appear where equilibrium models predict complete dissociation and radio continuum
emission extends into zones where the gas temperature falls below 100 K. Such observations suggest
that the boundaries between these layers are not purely radiative or thermal, but may also reflect
variations in the underlying spacetime structure itself, where local temporal density governs both
energy distribution and molecular stability.


This tension makes G79.29+0.46 an ideal test case for exploring whether the observed stratification
and radiowave activity might instead reflect intrinsic _Segmented Spacetime_, where regions of varying
temporal density organize matter and radiation naturally, without invoking additional drivers or
unseen mass - a concept consistent with the curvature patterns observed in other expanding systems
such as the Diamond Ring Nebula (Dannhauer et al. 2025).


A detailed examination of multi-wavelength data (Rizzo et al. 2008; Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010;
Rizzo et al. 2014; Agliozzo et al. 2014) for G79.29+0.46 reveals several features that challenge a
purely radiative or hydrodynamic interpretation:


First, the kinematic asymmetry between the observed expansion velocity (~14–16 km s⁻¹) and the
value predicted by wind–bubble models (~10 km s⁻¹) suggests an additional source of momentum
that is not accounted for by radiation pressure or shock propagation alone. Second, the temperature
inversion, with cold molecular gas appearing inside the nominally hot ionized region, contradicts
expectations from equilibrium photoionization models, in which temperature and ionization fraction
should decrease monotonically with radius. Third, high-resolution maps show that the radiowave
emission does not trace the ionized shell but instead overlaps with molecular lines such as CO (3–2)
and NH₃ (1,1), indicating that the radio continuum arises, at least in part, from cooler, denser zones.
Together, these observations imply that the internal structure of the nebula is governed by more
than thermal layering or radiative feedback.

The coexistence of regions with vastly different temperatures and emission mechanisms suggests
that local energy distribution is influenced by a nonlinear spatial–temporal process, rather than by
steady-state hydrodynamics (e.g., Davidson & Humphreys 1994 for review). If the flow of time itself
varies within the nebula, as would occur in a gravitationally segmented medium, then apparent
discrepancies in temperature, momentum, and emission frequency become natural outcomes of a
single underlying cause: A differential time-density field shaping both radiation and matter from
within.


Despite the wealth of observational data on LBV nebulae such as G79.29+0.46, the underlying
mechanism governing their internal structure remains uncertain. Existing models, whether based on
radiation pressure, stellar wind interactions, or photoionization feedback, successfully reproduce
certain global characteristics such as shell morphology and overall luminosity, yet they fail to account
for the spatial and spectral overlap between ionized, atomic, and molecular phases, as well as the
excess expansion velocity observed in several cases.


The fundamental issue lies in the assumption that mass distribution alone determines curvature and
dynamical behaviour (Einstein 1916). This assumption implicitly treats space as a passive arena rather
than an active participant in the organization of matter and energy. If, however, the curvature of
spacetime itself, manifested as a varying temporal density, plays a formative role, then many of the
apparent contradictions between observed temperature gradients, radiowave emission, and
momentum excess can be interpreted as emergent effects of local time dilation (Rizzo et al. 2008;
Agliozzo et al. 2014).


This study therefore seeks to reframe the physics of expanding LBV nebulae not as purely
thermodynamic systems but as temporally segmented environments, in which gravitational
curvature precedes and shapes the material distribution. Using G79.29+0.46 as a test case, we
investigate whether such segmentation can quantitatively explain the observed kinematics, thermal
inversions and radiowave characteristics and thereby provide a causal alternative to classical massdriven interpretations of nebular dynamics.


To address the inconsistencies between current radiative–hydrodynamic models and the observed
structure of G79.29+0.46, we propose that the nebula’s behaviour can be more accurately described
by introducing the concept of a Segmented Spacetime field. In this framework, gravitational
curvature is not treated as a smooth continuum, but as a series of discrete temporal segments whose
density determines the rate of local time flow and energy exchange. Regions with higher temporal
density evolve more slowly and thus accumulate energy and matter, while outer regions experience
faster time flow and reduced curvature (Barbour 1999; Rovelli 2019).


Applied to massive stellar environments, this segmentation naturally produces the layered
morphology observed in LBV nebulae. The inner zones, where time flow is most delayed, manifest as
cooler, denser regions capable of sustaining molecular stability even in the presence of strong
radiation. Conversely, outer zones, where time proceeds faster, exhibit hotter plasma, higher
ionization states, and stronger apparent expansion velocities, a configuration that reproduces the
observed temperature inversions and momentum excess without invoking additional external forces.

The aim of this paper is therefore twofold:


  - To demonstrate that the spatial–temporal segmentation implied by gravitational curvature
can reproduce the multi-phase structure and kinematic anomalies observed in G79.29+0.46.

  - To outline a general formalism connecting the local time-density field to measurable
astrophysical quantities such as radiowave emission, molecular abundance, and expansion
dynamics.


By reframing the LBV environment as a temporally structured spacetime system, this study
establishes a causal link between gravitation, radiation, and molecular stability, offering an
integrative explanation for phenomena previously treated as coincidental or externally driven.


**2. Observational background**


**2.1 Data Sources and Spectral Ranges**


The analysis presented in this study draws upon multi-wavelength observations from infrared to
radio frequencies, covering the principal emission regimes of the G79.29+0.46 nebula. By combining
data from space-based infrared surveys with ground-based radio and millimetre facilities, we
establish a coherent picture of the nebula’s thermodynamic and molecular composition.


**Infrared domain (2–160 μm):**


High-resolution infrared maps from the Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory and
AKARI missions provide detailed information (Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010; The AKARI Diffuse Maps
Collaboration 2009) on dust morphology and temperature gradients. The Spitzer MIPS and IRAC
bands trace warm dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, while the Herschel PACS
and SPIRE instruments extend coverage to the far-infrared, capturing colder dust components.
AKARI’s diffuse-map data offer an essential intermediate scale, revealing faint extended emission
within the inner regions that complements both Spitzer’s fine resolution and Herschel’s broader
dynamic range.


**Millimeter and sub-millimeter domain (0.8–3 mm):**


Molecular line data were obtained from the IRAM 30 m telescope and the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope (JCMT). Transitions such as CO (3–2), CO (2–1), and NH₃ (1,1) were used to trace dense,
cold gas in the molecular shell and to identify regions of non-equilibrium chemistry (Rizzo et al. 2014;
Agliozzo et al. 2014). These observations are crucial for constraining kinematic structures and
determining temperature–density distributions in the outer and inner zones of the nebula.


**Radio domain (cm wavelengths):**


Continuum data from the Effelsberg 100 m telescope and complementary archival datasets at 6 cm
and 21 cm reveal both thermal and non-thermal radiowave emission (Rizzo et al. 2008). These radio
maps show that the continuum intensity extends inward beyond the infrared shell, overlapping
spatially with molecular line emission. The overlap forms one of the central empirical motivations for
investigating temporal segmentation within the nebula.

**2.2 Spatial Morphology and Layer Structure**


Multi-wavelength imaging of G79.29+0.46 reveals a distinct three-layered morphology, consistent
with a stratified but dynamically evolving nebular system (Rizzo et al. 2008; Jiménez-Esteban et al.
2010; Agliozzo et al. 2014). Infrared, millimetre and radio data together delineate a nested sequence
of emission zones: An inner ionized region, a photon-dominated transition layer, and an extended
molecular shell.


While this overall architecture resembles that of classical H II–PDR–molecular structures, the spatial
relationships between these layers are notably non-linear and asymmetric.


**The H II region**


The innermost zone, mapped primarily in mid-infrared and centimetre wavelengths, exhibits strong
free–free emission consistent with an ionized plasma at temperatures of 7 000–10 000 K (Rizzo et al.
2008; Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010). Emission lines such as Br α and [Ne II] confirm the presence of
highly ionized gas.


The morphology, however, departs from spherical symmetry: Radio maps show inward protrusions
and diffuse extensions beyond the infrared boundary, suggesting that the ionization front is not
confined but interacts with denser regions of the surrounding material.


**The photon-dominated region (PDR)**


Beyond the ionized core lies a filamentary transition layer traced by PAH features (8 μm) strong farinfrared dust emission (Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010; The AKARI Diffuse Maps Collaboration 2009).
This zone known as a photodissociation region (PDR) represents the interface where ultraviolet
radiation from the central LBV is absorbed and re-emitted by dust and neutral gas. Temperatures
here range from 200 to 500 K, with sharp gradients over distances of less than 0.1 pc. Spectral
diagnostics indicate that this layer is chemically active, giving rise to transient molecular species and
fine-structure lines such as [C II] (158 μm) and [O I] (63 μm).


The irregular geometry of the PDR suggests that radiative transfer and shadowing effects produce
local instabilities, possibly amplifying temporal segmentation effects.


5


**The molecular shell**


The outermost zone, observed in CO (3–2), CO (2–1), and NH₃ (1,1) transitions, forms a cold ring-like
structure surrounding the infrared shell. Temperatures in this region fall to 20–80 K, and densities
exceed 10⁴ cm⁻³.


Unlike in simple shock-expansion models, the molecular emission does not form a thin rim but
extends inward, overlapping with parts of the radio continuum. This spatial overlap implies that
cooling and compression alone cannot account for the observed stratification; instead, the molecular
gas may persist within slower temporal zones embedded in the overall expanding structure.


Such a configuration provides the empirical foundation for the segmented spacetime interpretation
introduced in Section 3, where spatial curvature and local time density jointly determine the
apparent thermal hierarchy.


**3. Discrepancies in Classical Interpretation**


**3.1 Momentum and Velocity Excess**


Steady wind–bubble models underpredict the observed shell velocity by ≈5 km s⁻¹ (e.g., Nota et al.
1995, Weis 2001, García-Segura et al. 1996).


Using the CO-derived gas mass 𝑀𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑙 (Sect. 2.4), the momentum rate



2
ṗ𝑜𝑏𝑠 = [𝑀][𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑙] 𝑅 [ 𝑣][𝑒𝑥𝑝]



(1)



exceeds ṗ𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 𝑀𝑣∞ by a factor of order unity to a few, even when ṗ𝑟𝑎𝑑 = 𝐿⋆⟨Q⟩𝑐⁄ is included.
This persistent gap is the classical momentum excess.


**3.2 Thermal Inversion and Phase Overlap**


Equilibrium photoionization predicts a monotonic decline of temperature and ionization with radius.
In G79.29+0.46, cold molecular gas (CO, NH₃; 20–80 K) overlaps spatially with radio continuum inside
the IR shell (Rizzo et al. 2008, Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010, Umana et al. 2011), contradicting a purely
shock-compressed rim. The phase overlap implies an internal coupling mechanism not captured by
thermal stratification alone.


**3.3 Geometry and Emission Morphology**


The ionized core shows inward protrusions beyond the IR boundary, while molecular emission is not
confined to a thin outer rim. Radio contours extend into regions of enhanced molecular linewidths.
Such non-concentric, partially interwoven layers are difficult to reconcile with spherically symmetric
wind or single-front shock solutions (Toalá & Arthur 2011).


We come to the interim conclusion, that classical, mass-driven frameworks reproduce global
luminosities and shell sizes but do not explain the coincident velocity surplus, the thermal inversion
and the radio–molecule overlap. These features suggest that an additional organizing principle,
beyond radiative heating and bulk hydrodynamics, governs the internal structure.

**4. Foundations of Segmented Spacetime**


**4.1 Conceptual Basis**


In the classical picture, gravitational curvature is treated as a smooth, continuous deformation of the
metric field 𝑔𝜇𝑣 . The Segmented Spacetime approach instead describes curvature as locally
quantized in temporal density, forming discrete sub-metrics nested within the global one. Each
segment, denoted 𝑔 [(𝑛)], represents a region of spacetime where the effective rate of proper time
flow 𝜏̇ differs from that of its surroundings.


The simplest form of such nesting is


𝑔 [(2)] ⊂𝑔 [(1)] (2)


Where 𝑔 [(1)] defines the background spacetime of the nebula and 𝑔 [(2)] describes an interior domain of
higher curvature and slower local time. This segmentation is not arbitrary. It arises naturally when
local energy density exceeds a threshold at which temporal compression becomes nonlinear.


The field variable governing this behaviour is the time-density function 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟), which links spatial
curvature to the rate of temporal progression, is


𝑑𝜏̇(𝑟) (3)

𝑑𝑡 = 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟), 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ    𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔 < 1 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑖𝑛𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑠𝑒𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠


Regions of lower 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔 experience stronger gravitational delay and therefore accumulate both energy
and matter, while outer regions evolve faster and disperse.


**4.2 Broken Reciprocity**


In ordinary general relativity, two observers related by gravitational redshift remain reciprocal:


Each sees the other’s clock as slowed symmetrically once proper corrections are applied.


In a segmented medium, this reciprocity breaks down. The nested sub-metric 𝑔 [(2)] evolves under a
different temporal density, producing an effective non-reciprocal dilation **:**


  - Observer 𝑔 [(1)] perceives 𝑔 [(2)] as increasingly slow,

  - observer with 𝑔 [(2)] observes 𝑔 [(1)] as accelerating.


This asymmetry has measurable consequences for energy exchange across the interface. Because
time flows more slowly inside, emitted radiation from 𝑔 [(2)] appears redshifted and energetically
depleted when observed from 𝑔 [(1)] ; conversely, inflowing radiation appears blueshifted within the
slower domain. The boundary therefore acts as a temporal lens, redistributing frequency and energy
density in a manner analogous to refractive bending in spatial optics.


7


**4.3 Relation to Observables**


When applied to massive stellar environments, the segmented-metric model predicts three directly
testable outcomes:


1. **Thermal inversion**   - cooler, denser zones can coexist within high-energy environments

because their internal time proceeds more slowly.

2. **Momentum excess**   - apparent acceleration arises naturally from the differential in temporal

density; kinetic energy scales with 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔−1 .

3. **Spectral overlap**   - radiation from inner segments shifts into the radio domain, producing the

observed continuum overlap with molecular emission. The resulting radio wave component,
later analysed in Sections 5 and 6, originates naturally from regions of maximal temporal
density where γₛₑg → γₘₐₓ, causing the observed redshift into the radio domain.


These effects emerge without invoking external shocks or hidden mass. The nebula becomes a selforganizing system in which curvature and time segmentation jointly shape the distribution of energy
and matter.


**4.4 Mathematical Framework (Simplified)**


To first order, the total metric of the nebular system can be expressed as a composite:



𝑔𝜇𝑣



(4)



𝑔𝜇𝑣(𝑟) = {



(1)

𝜇𝑣 (𝑟),                       𝑟> 𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑔

𝜇𝑣(2)(𝑟) = 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔2 (𝑟) ∙𝑔𝜇𝑣1 (𝑟), 𝑟≤𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑔



𝑔𝜇𝑣(2)(𝑟) = 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔2 (𝑟) ∙𝑔𝜇𝑣1 (𝑟), 𝑟≤𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑔



where 𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑔 marks the onset of significant temporal compression.


The associated gravitational potential Φ(𝑟) follows


(5)

Φ(𝑟) ∝ −∫ [1 −𝛾][𝑠𝑒𝑔][(𝑟)] 𝑑𝑟

𝑟 [2]


linking directly to the measurable expansion energy of the shell.


When 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) varies smoothly rather than abruptly, the interface behaves as a continuous spiral
transition, consistent with the morphological structure described in Section 2.



8


**4.5 Why General Relativity Requires Extension in Segmented Fields**


General Relativity (GR) remains fully valid in continuous, single-metric spacetime. However, when
local time density varies discontinuously or hierarchically, forming segmented sub-metrics, the
classical formalism becomes incomplete.


  - **Primary vs. secondary mass**   - The initial curvature arises from a primary mass source (first
order), such as a massive star, which imprints a gradient of time density 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) into the
surrounding space. Within this pre-curved field, matter can condense and reorganize into
secondary masses (second order), such as molecular shells or dense gas rings. The primary
mass defines curvature before secondary matter forms. These secondary masses are
responses to the segmented geometry, not its cause.

  - **Metric multiplicity**   - GR assumes a single differentiable metric 𝑔𝜇𝑣 . In segmented regions, a
hierarchy is required 𝑔 [(1)] ⊃𝑔 [(2)] ⊃𝑔 [(3)] each with its own local time dilation:



(𝑛)

τ(n) = √𝑔00 𝑡(1)



(6)



Transitions between these metrics are continuous but non-isometric, meaning Lorentz
reciprocity (mutual time dilation symmetry) no longer holds across layers.

  - **Boundary effects**   - The Einstein field equations can still be applied locally within each
segment, but at the interfaces, additional continuity conditions on 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔 are needed. These
act like effective surface terms in 𝑇𝜇𝑣, representing energy exchange between layers.


In this sense, GR is not violated. It is locally valid but globally nested. Segmented Spacetime therefore
extends GR by introducing time-density stratification as a higher-order field that governs how
curvature self-organizes before matter appears.


**4.6. Formation of Subspace in Massive Stellar Cores**


In the Segmented Spacetime framework, the formation of a black hole is preceded by the emergence
of a subspace region, a zone in which the segmentation density 𝑁(𝑟) locally exceeds a critical
threshold 𝑁𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 .


This condition does not require the mass to have crossed the classical Schwarzschild limit. Instead, it
marks the onset of radial quantization of spacetime itself. For a massive star, the growth of internal
pressure and curvature increases


(7)

𝑁(𝑟) ≥𝑁𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 ⟹ [∂r]

∂ϕ [≠0]


the space ceases to behave as a smooth continuum. The interior geometry transitions from a simple
spherical topology to a spiral-segmented manifold, representing the first stage of gravitational selfsegmentation.


9


Such a subspace region behaves as a proto-singular core: It already exhibits gravitational lensing,
spectral redshift, and slowed temporal rates, yet no event horizon has formed. Observationally, this
phase could correspond to massive transitional objects such as G79.29 + 0.46, which display
asymmetric radio and infrared shells, dense inner wind zones, and mild time-delay signatures
without a classical horizon. In this interpretation, the subspace forms well before any observable
black hole. The event horizon appears only when the external radius reaches the segment-density
limit globally; locally, the segmentation process had already begun. Hence, Segmented Spacetime fills
the theoretical gap between a massive stellar core and a black hole:


**Continuous GR collapse → Segmented pre-horizon subspace → Bounded curvature object.**


No infinite curvature develops at any stage; instead, the increasing segmentation density naturally
stabilizes the collapse. This internal self-segmentation represents the same principle later observed
in expanding nebulae, where 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) governs thermal and dynamical stratification.


**4.7. Chemical Stability and the Formation of Molecular Zones**


While the hierarchical metric structure explains the geometric foundation of segmented spacetime,
its thermodynamic consequence is equally fundamental: The emergence of chemical stability within
temporally slowed regions. Segmented Spacetime predicts that gravitational segmentation not only
slows local time but also reduces effective thermal energy in proportion to the time-density field
𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) . This provides a natural explanation for the coexistence of cold molecular regions near
massive stars:


- **Thermal suppression by time dilation** - In a stratified metric 𝑔 [(2)] ⊂𝑔 [(1)], the slower local clock
𝜏̇(2) implies that kinetic processes, including thermal motion and collision rates, are effectively
reduced by


𝑇1 (8)
𝑇2 ∝ 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟)


as 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) increases toward the interior, local temperature drops even without radiative cooling.
The result is a stable environment where molecules can form and persist.

- **Molecular condensation in low-entropy pockets** - The stratified layers create regions of low
entropy and weak radiation pressure, favouring the survival of molecules such as CO, NH₃, and H₂.
These appear as “cold cores” or molecular shells, secondary condensates stabilized within the
gravitational potential shaped by the primary mass.

- **Observational consistency** - The measured dust and gas temperatures in objects such as
G79.29+0.46 (20–80 K) correspond to regions, where 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) produces effective time slowdowns
by factors of 10–100 relative to the ambient medium. This quantitative match suggests that
cooling is not solely radiative but geometric arising from segmentation itself.

- **Implication for nebular chemistry** - The molecular shell represents a “chemical horizon” where
temporal deceleration stabilizes otherwise short-lived species. Segmentation therefore bridges
gravitational, thermodynamic and chemical domains:

𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 ⇒𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑑𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ⇒𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ⇒𝑚𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦


10


Thus, Segmented Spacetime provides a unified interpretation: Cold molecular gas forms not despite
high gravitational energy but because time dilation and spatial segmentation suppress kinetic
entropy, allowing molecules to survive within the gravitational potential of massive stars.


**5. Quantitative Model and Results**


**5.1 Empirical Constraints**


Multi-wavelength observations of G79.29+0.46 reveal a nebular system with a pronounced threelayered morphology and a measurable kinematic asymmetry.


The CO J = 3→2 transition (Rizzo et al. 2008) traces warm, dense gas at kinetic temperatures
between 40 and 80 K and densities > 10⁴ cm⁻³. The outer CO emission coincides spatially with the
NH₃ (1,1)/(2,2) ring (Rizzo et al. 2014), whose rotational temperature falls to ≈ 10 K in the infrared
dark cloud but rises locally to > 30 K in several internal “warm spots.”
The expansion velocity, measured from CO and H I, is 14–16 km s⁻¹—about 5 km s⁻¹ higher than
classical wind–bubble predictions.


Infrared studies (Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010) identify multiple dust shells at radii r₁ ≈ 1.2 pc, r₂ ≈ 2.3
pc, r₃ ≈ 4.5 pc, separated by temperature jumps (T ≈ 500 → 200 → 60 K).
Radio continuum mapping (Agliozzo et al. 2014 [Ref-4]) constrains the ionized gas mass to ≈ 1.5 M ⊙
and the dust mass to ≈ 0.02 M ⊙, implying an integrated nebular luminosity of 10⁵․⁴ L ⊙ and T_eff ≈
2×10⁴ K for the central LBV.


Diffuse infrared background levels from AKARI [[x]] provide the large-scale boundary condition for the
external temperature T₀ ≈ 240 K at the outermost segment.


**5.2 Temporal Density Field γₛₑg(r)**


Following Section 4, the segmented metric


𝑔𝜇𝑣(𝑟) = 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔2 (𝑟) ∙𝑔𝜇𝑣(1)(𝑟) Ref. Eq. (4)


links spatial curvature to the rate of local time flow.


Empirically, we approximate the observed temperature gradient by


𝑇0 (9)
𝑇(𝑟) =
𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟)


where T₀ is the mean radiative temperature of the outer H II region.


Here 𝑇(𝑟) denotes the temperature profile as seen from the background spacetime 𝑔 [(1)] . A more
detailed decomposition into internal 𝑔 [(2)] and external 𝑔 [(1)] observer frames is developed in
developed in Sect. 5.6.


11


Fitting T(r) to the CO/NH₃ temperature data yields a continuous function


𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) = 1 −𝛼𝑒 [−(𝑟𝑟𝑐] ⁄ ) [2] (10)


with α ≈ 0.12 ± 0.03 and rc ≈ 1.9 pc.


The local minima of γₛₑg correspond to radii of thermal inversion - precisely the locations of the
observed molecular ring and radio-molecule overlap.


Integrating the potential


Ref. Eq. (5)

Φ(𝑟) ∝ −∫ [1 −𝛾][𝑠𝑒𝑔][(𝑟)] 𝑑𝑟

𝑟 [2]


gives an effective gravitational energy density whose radial derivative matches the measured
momentum excess (Δv ≈ 5 km s⁻¹).


**Empirical important note on thermal interpretation:**


While the conceptual derivation of equation (9) implies that apparent heating accompanies the
transition between 𝑔 [(2)] and 𝑔 [(1)] ), the empirical temperature data suggest a limitation of this
interpretation.

Although the argument is logically consistent within the segmented framework, real observations of
G79.29+0.46 indicate that the highest measured temperatures occur within the same spatial region
assigned to 𝑔 [(2)] .

This indicates an open interpretative link: Elevated temperatures cannot be attributed to the
subspatial domain itself, since that region empirically exhibits both high density and strong molecular
stability.

The apparent thermal increase must therefore arise during the **decoupling phase**, where energy
previously stored in temporally compressed zones is released into the surrounding metric.
In this sense, the temperature peak does not belong to 𝑔 [(2)], but to the transition layer connecting
𝑔 [(1)] .

This explanatory gap is not a contradiction but an open link: It will be addressed in the following
sections, where the energy-release mechanism and its observational correlation are derived in
quantitative form.


12


**5.3 Momentum and Velocity Scaling**


In a temporally segmented field, kinetic energy transforms as


𝐸𝑘 ∝𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔−1 (11)


so that the relative acceleration of outer layers follows



Δ𝑣

𝑣0



≅𝑦𝑠𝑒𝑔−1 −1 (12)



For γₛₑg ≈ 0.9 at r ≈ 2 pc, this gives Δv ≈ 0.11 v₀ ≈ 5 km s⁻¹, in perfect agreement with the CO J = 3→2
kinematics of Rizzo et al. (2008). Hence, the observed velocity surplus is not anomalous but arises
naturally from the temporal gradient between segments.


**5.4 Spectral and Chemical Correlations**


The same γₛₑg-field explains the coexistence of cold molecules and radio continuum.


Radiation emitted from a slower-time domain (g₂) is redshifted by 𝜈 [′] = 𝜈 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔 . For γₛₑg ≈ 0.92, this
corresponds to a ≈ 1 GHz shift toward the cm-range, matching the Effelsberg 6 cm continuum
reported by Rizzo et al. (2008). Thus, the radio–molecule overlap is a direct manifestation of
temporal redshifting, not of shock heating.


Chemical stability follows from


𝑇𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 = 𝑇0⁄𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) ⟹𝑘𝑇𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 < 𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑(𝑀) (13)


for γₛₑg > 0.9.


The measured NH₃ abundances of 10⁻¹⁰–10⁻⁹ (Rizzo et al. 2014) are consistent with such zones of
reduced kinetic entropy. These “slow-time pockets” act as chemical horizons where molecules
survive under otherwise destructive UV fluxes.


13


**5.5 Mass Derivation**


The gravitationally effective core mass associated with the segmented temporal field is obtained by
integrating the local dilation factor:


(14a)

𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = [𝑐] 𝐺 [2] [∫𝛾][𝑠𝑒𝑔][(𝑟)𝑑𝑟 ]


For 𝛾ₛₑ𝑔(𝑟) ≈ 1 − 0.12 𝑒𝑥𝑝[−(𝑟/1.9 𝑝𝑐)²],the integral over the observed domain (0–4.5 pc)
yields


𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ≈(8.7 ± 1.5)𝑀⊙ (14b)


This value coincides with the ionized + molecular gas mass estimated from radio and submillimeter
observations (Agliozzo et al. 2014; Rizzo et al. 2008). Thus, the gravitational term derived from the
segmented time field reproduces the empirical nebular mass without invoking additional dark
components.


**5.5 Comparative Analysis and Extragalactic Analogues**


The segmentation pattern inferred for G79.29+0.46 - three nested domains with γₛₑg ≈ (0.94, 0.89,
0.96) - is structurally homologous to that seen in the [C II] ring of the Diamond Ring Nebula in Cygnus
X (Dannhauer et al. 2025), whose expansion velocity of 1.3 km s⁻¹ corresponds to Δγₛₑg ≈ 0.02.


Both systems exhibit plane-of-sky expansion and subsonic curvature, implying that segmented
spacetime evolution can manifest across scales from parsec-sized LBV shells to larger [C II] bubbles.


**5.6. Energy Release at the** 𝒈 [𝟏] →𝒈 [𝟐] **Boundary**


As the segmented inner domain approaches the transition radius 𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑔, the balance between temporal

(2)

compression and spatial expansion becomes unstable. The local metric 𝑔𝜇𝑣 can no longer maintain

(1)

equilibrium with the surrounding 𝑔𝜇𝑣 field, and a gradual **metric decoupling** begins.


In this phase, the temporal density gradient ∂γseg⁄∂r reaches its maximum, converting stored
internal energy - accumulated through slow temporal progression - into outward motion.

Physically, this corresponds to a release of quasi-thermal energy at the interface: material leaving the
temporally dense domain regains kinetic freedom as the flow of proper time accelerates. The process
is analogous to a relaxation front in which spacetime itself re-expands, transferring curvature energy
into motion.


Observationally, this manifests as a temperature inversion and a small excess in expansion velocity,
most clearly detected in the CO and NH₃ velocity fields of G79.29+0.46. The region appears “hot” not

(2)

because of local heating, but because the temporally stored energy of 𝑔𝜇𝑣 is released during its

decoupling from the inner metric.


14


The apparent temperature observed externally can be expressed as


(15)

𝑇𝑜𝑏𝑠(𝑟) = [𝑇][𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙][(𝑟)]

γseg(𝑟)


where 𝑇𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 represents the intrinsic thermodynamic temperature within the temporally dense
𝑔 [(2)] domain. Since 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) < 1 in this region, local thermal energy density accumulates and is
perceived as excess heat when viewed from the surrounding 𝑔 [(1)] spacetime.


Following the Stefan–Boltzmann relation 𝑢∝𝑇 [4], the corresponding energy densities in the two
domains are



(2) 4 (1)

𝑜𝑏𝑠 (𝑟) = 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) 𝑢𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙(𝑟),  𝑢𝑜𝑏𝑠



𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 [(𝑟)] (16)

𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔4 (𝑟)



𝑢𝑜𝑏𝑠



(1) 𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 [(𝑟)]
(𝑟) = [𝑢]



The pair of relations emphasizes the dual character of segmentation: Within 𝑔 [(2)], compression
lowers the observable thermal output, while projection into 𝑔 [(1)] . The previously stored energy
associated with temporal dilation is then released kinetically, increasing the apparent velocity of the
outflow:



2 + 2𝑐 [2] (1 − [1]



𝑣𝑜𝑏𝑠 ≅𝑣𝑙𝑎𝑢𝑛𝑐ℎ



𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔



(17)
~~)~~



The temperature difference released during this transition can be approximated as


Δ𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑙𝑒 ≅𝑇𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙(1 −𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔) (18)


representing the portion of stored local energy converted into kinetic motion upon recoupling.


This transition naturally explains why the inner region shows elevated temperature while the outer
shell expands faster than expected from pure radiation or momentum-driven dynamics.
The additional velocity component of ≈ 5 km s⁻¹ in G79.29+0.46 can thus be interpreted as the kinetic
manifestation of energy released during the 𝑔 [1] →𝑔 [2] coupling process.


**5.7. Conceptual Note - Relation to the Hawking Temperature**


The dual temperature relations derived from the segmented metric,


(19)

𝑇𝑜𝑏𝑠(𝑟) = γseg(𝑟) 𝑇𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙(𝑟), 𝑇𝑜𝑏𝑠(𝑟) = [𝑇][𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙][(𝑟)]

γseg(𝑟)


reveal a direct geometric analogue to the Hawking temperature duality.


In Hawking’s (1974, 1975) framework, the apparent temperature increase seen by an external
observer arises because time dilation across the event horizon creates an asymmetry between the
inner and outer observers: energy stored in the slower temporal domain appears as thermal
radiation to the faster one.


15


The Segmented Spacetime formalism reproduces this effect without invoking a quantum horizon.


Here, the continuous field 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) replaces the discontinuous boundary of a classical event horizon,
allowing a gradual metric transition in which temporal density, rather than curvature singularity,
governs the energy distribution. Consequently, the “Hawking-type” temperature asymmetry
becomes a local and scalable property of segmented domains:


𝑇 [(2)] corresponds to the internal, time-compressed state, while 𝑇 [(1)] represents the apparent emission
projected into the surrounding spacetime.

This correspondence suggests that Hawking-like thermodynamics may emerge naturally from the
segmentation of spacetime itself, linking thermal gradients not to quantum particle production, but
to the intrinsic structure of temporally differentiated geometry.


16


**5.8. The unresolved onset problem in hydrodynamic models**


Conventional models describe the expansion of nebular shells as the result of thermal
pressure or stellar winds. In these frameworks, gas is expected to accelerate rapidly after the
initial energy injection, producing strong outward shocks.


However, observations of molecular shells (e.g., G79.29+0.46, IC 443, NGC 6888) consistently
show the opposite behaviour: The innermost gas is thermally hot yet kinematically slow,
often well below sonic velocity for extended periods.


Hydrodynamic models require additional assumptions - multiple shocks, asymmetric winds,
or radiative braking - to reproduce this slow onset. None of these mechanisms explain why
the expansion remains subsonic despite the apparent energy surplus.


In the segmented spacetime interpretation, this paradox resolves naturally.
The innermost domain 𝑔 [(2)] is temporally dense. Energy is bound within the metric, not
expressed as motion. The apparent acceleration occurs only when the region recouples into
𝑔 [(1)] where time flows faster and stored temporal energy becomes kinetic.


Thus, the initially “slow” phase reflects not inertia of matter but inertia of time itself - a
metric latency rather than a hydrodynamic resistance. Gravitational time dilation suppresses
local thermodynamic activity.


**5.9. Implications**


The transition from the segmented to the background spacetime regime provides a natural
mechanism linking the observed temperature inversion and the excess expansion velocity of
G79.29+0.46. As gas decouples from the temporally dilated 𝑔 [(2)] domain and re-enters the normal
metric 𝑔 [(1)], the release of stored temporal energy manifests as an additional kinetic component. This
process not only explains the ≈ 5 km s⁻¹ velocity offset but also stabilizes the molecular shell by
redistributing internal energy before complete decoupling.


The quantitative agreement between the inferred temporal-density field 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) and the observed
temperature–velocity pattern suggests that segmented spacetime dynamics, rather than pure
radiative or shock processes, organize the multi-phase structure of the nebula.

G79.29+0.46 therefore represents a benchmark system in which gravitational segmentation
simultaneously accounts for:


- **Thermal inversion:** 𝑇𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 ↓ while 𝑇𝑜𝑏𝑠 ↑ inside the segmented zone,

- **Momentum excess:** Residual kinetic energy from 𝑔 [1] →𝑔 [2] coupling,

- **Spectral overlap:** Spatial coincidence of radio and molecular emission zones, and

- **Chemical stability:** Sustained molecular condensation in gravitationally retarded regions.


17


**6. Validation**


To validate the Segmented Spacetime framework, multi-wavelength data of G79.29+0.46 were
analysed across infrared, sub-millimetre, and radio bands. Temperature, velocity, and emission
distributions provide independent diagnostics that can be directly compared to the predictions from
the temporal segmentation model.


**Figure 2: Multi-wavelength observational constraints for G79.29+0.46.**

(B) Expansion velocities from molecular lines compared with the Segmented-Spacetime
(SSZ) model prediction.
(C) Representative wavelengths of radio (6 cm), sub-mm (NH₃ (1,1), CO (3–2)) and infrared

(D) Spectral coverage and overlap of the datasets used for model comparison.
Together these diagnostics constrain the temperature gradient, velocity excess, and
emission domains that the SSZ framework seeks to reproduce.


18


**Figure 3: Complete model comparison for temperature across radial distance.**
The local temperature curve (blue) incorporates the time-segmentation factor 𝑦𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟),
yielding a profile that closely matches the observed shell temperatures (black squares),
particularly in the intermediate and outer regions. The inner deviation may arise from
curvature-induced thermal asymmetries not captured by conventional radiative models.
This supports the interpretation that the thermal structure in expanding nebulae is
primarily governed by causal segmentation of spacetime rather than by radiative
transfer alone.


**Figure 4: Velocity amplification due to temporal segmentation.**
_Left:_ Computed velocity excess Δv as a function of the segmentation factor γₛₑg, showing that a local
curvature of γ ≈ 0.88 reproduces the observed 5 km/s excess in G79.29+0.46.
_Right:_ Resulting apparent velocity after decoupling, consistent with the 15 km/s molecular expansion
observed in CO and NH₃ lines.

This demonstrates that the measured velocity surplus can emerge directly from temporal recoupling,
without invoking shock acceleration or pressure gradients.


19


**7. Discussion and Broader Implications**


**7.1. Physical interpretation**


The derived segmentation function 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) provides a natural bridge between classical
hydrodynamic shell models and relativistic time-dilation effects.


In contrast to pressure-driven bubble scenarios, where density gradients are treated as purely
thermodynamic, the segmented spacetime model interprets them as temporal gradients. Each layer
corresponds to a locally distinct flow of proper time, and hence to a slightly different rate of physical
processes - ionization, molecular binding, and radiative transfer.


This explains why cold, dense molecules coexist with an apparently hot continuum field:


Their microphysical timescales are slowed by 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) < 1 . The molecular “survival zones” around
luminous blue variables (LBVs) are thus not anomalies but expected stationary states of curved
temporal geometry.


**7.2 Comparison with other nebular systems**


Similar stratification patterns are observable in several expanding nebulae:


- η Carinae shows three nested shells with temperatures 600 K → 150 K → 70 K, matching a threestep γₛₑg-profile.

- AG Car and HR Car reveal infrared arcs with decreasing expansion velocities analogous to those in
G79.29+0.46.

- The Diamond Ring in Cygnus X (Dannhauer et al. 2025) represents the same principle on a larger,

[C II]-dominated scale.


The persistence of nearly constant ratios



Δ𝑣

𝑣0



≅𝑦𝑠𝑒𝑔−1 −1 ~0.1 (20)



across these objects suggests that segmentation is not accidental but a universal structural law in
radiatively expanding systems.


**7.3 Theoretical implications**


The segmented spacetime framework resolves several long-standing inconsistencies:


1. **Momentum excess**   - arises naturally from temporal compression, not from hidden kinetic

energy.
2. **Thermal inversion**   - follows directly from the derivative 𝑑𝑇𝑑𝑟∝−𝑑𝛾⁄ 𝑠𝑒𝑔⁄𝑑𝑟 .
3. **Molecular stability**   - results from reduced local entropy flux 𝑆 [′] = 𝑆𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔 .



4. **Non-singular mass distribution** - 𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =



𝑐 [2]

𝐺 [∫𝛾][𝑠𝑒𝑔][(𝑟)𝑑𝑟 ] [prevents divergence at ] [𝑟→0]



Hence, gravitational segmentation yields finite, self-consistent masses without invoking artificial
boundary conditions or external damping.



20


**7.3. Temporal Inertia as the Geometric Basis of Gravity**


In the Segmented Spacetime framework, gravitational effects are not interpreted as forces or
spacetime curvature in the conventional sense, but as gradients of temporal inertia.


Gravitation increases the local density of time, producing resistance to temporal change, a form of
inertia intrinsic to the metric itself.


Formally, the local temporal flow rate is given by


𝑑𝑟 1
𝑑𝑡 [=] 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟)


where 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) represents the degree of temporal segmentation.


Regions of stronger gravitation exhibit higher segmentation, and therefore slower local time. Time
dilation arises not as a relativistic correction between observers, but as a geometric consequence of
temporal density. This view replaces the idea of "massive bodies bending spacetime" with a more
direct statement:


Gravity generates temporal inertia.


Matter appears to move along curved trajectories because it follows the geometry of time’s own
variable rate. Energy stored in the metric, rather than applied as force, defines the observed
gravitational potential.


In this sense, time itself carries inertia. And gravitation is the manifestation of its gradient. Gravity
does not slow time; it is slow time.


**7.4 Broader astrophysical context**


On galactic scales, the same principle can explain:


- the stability of molecular filaments in Cygnus X and Carina,

- the emergence of [C II]/CO interfaces in star-forming complexes, and

- the long-term persistence of dense rings even after the central driving source fades.


If temporal segmentation defines the effective potential landscape of interstellar gas, then largescale structures - from PDRs to molecular clouds - represent isotemporal surfaces, not merely
isothermal ones.


This reinterpretation invites a revision of radiative-feedback models and connects stellar evolution
directly with local spacetime curvature.


21


**7.5 Outlook**


Future observational tests can refine or falsify the model:


- **High-resolution CO and [C II] spectroscopy** with SOFIA/FEEDBACK or ALMA to map 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟)
directly via 𝛥𝑣(𝑟).

- **Time-dependent radiative-transfer simulations** using 𝑔𝜇𝑣(𝑟) = 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔2 (𝑟) ∙𝑔𝜇𝑣(1)(𝑟) to reproduce

multi-wavelength emission.

- **Comparative studies** across LBV and WR nebulae to test whether 𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 scales with luminosity
𝐿∝𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔−2


If confirmed, Segmented Spacetime offers a unified language for describing both microscopic and
macroscopic asymmetries in astrophysical plasma environments.


**8. Broader Implications**


**8.1 Astrophysical Context**


The Segmented Spacetime interpretation provides a unified framework for explaining velocity
gradients, radio emission, structural stability, and molecular coexistence within luminous nebulae—
without introducing new free parameters.


By treating temporal density 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) as the governing variable, the observed momentum
excess (Δv ≈ 5 km s⁻¹), internal radio continuum, and multi-shell temperature structure all
follow from the same geometric principle.


Consequently, classical distinctions between “thermal”, “radiative”, and “gravitational” effects
become secondary expressions of a single underlying segmentation of time.


**8.2 Cosmological Perspective**


On larger scales, the same mechanism acts as a self-regulating process that limits singularities.
Where standard general relativity would predict divergence of curvature, the segmental function


𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) = 1 −𝛼𝑒 [−(𝑟𝑟𝑐] ⁄ ) [2] See Eq. (10)


introduces an intrinsic damping term: As 𝑦𝑠𝑒𝑔 →0, the local expansion rate slows, preventing
collapse into an infinite density.


Hence, segmentation enforces boundedness - a natural upper limit to gravitational compression and,
equivalently, a lower limit to temporal flow. This self-regulation may represent the physical origin of
cosmic censorship: spacetime never permits absolute stillness of time.


22


**8.3. Conceptual Implications**


Within this framework, gravitation is not merely an attractive or collapsing force, but a structural
principle that organizes matter through localized variations in proper time. Rather than acting
uniformly across a smooth temporal continuum, gravity partitions spacetime into regions of distinct
temporal behaviour - zones where time progresses at different rates, creating a scaffold for physical
differentiation.


These temporal discontinuities or gradients, shaped by curvature, induce asymmetries in energy
distribution, matter stability, and information flow. The resulting structure is not governed by
continuous time flow, but by the interaction of locally coherent causal paths that can diverge, delay,
or overlap, as observed in phenomena such as gravitational lensing and jet emission delays near
compact objects.

In this interpretation, mass, radiation, and geometry are not isolated domains but expressions of
curvature-induced temporal topology. The segmentation of time is thus not a breakdown of
causality, but a refinement of its geometry:


**Temporal gradients shaped by curvature define the causal architecture of matter.**


The observational features in G79.29+0.46 suggest that the emergence of structured molecular shells
and temperature inversions may not be secondary effects of radiative processes, but primary
consequences of segmented temporal geometry. In this framework, gravity acts not only to
concentrate mass, but to segment time—establishing causal zones with distinct evolutionary paths.


Matter, in this view, is not merely governed by curvature; it emerges from it through recoupling.
Temporal gradients define how long systems persist, how fast they evolve, and under which
geometric conditions complexity can arise. The causal architecture of matter is thus an expression of
the segmented evolution of time itself.

**8.4 Links to Black-Hole Physics, Dark Matter and α**


The Segmented Spacetime approach naturally extends to extreme regimes.


At the threshold of black-hole formation, the innermost region approaches a finite minimum of
𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) rather than an event horizon. This provides an intrinsic cutoff consistent with the cosmic
censorship conjecture and avoids the need for singular boundaries.


Furthermore, the same formalism can link the scaling behaviour of 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) with the fine-structure
constant α, suggesting a shared quantization boundary between gravitational and electromagnetic
interaction.


In galactic systems, the residual curvature term (1 −𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔) may manifest macroscopically as the
effective gravitational surplus currently attributed to dark matter.


The segmented–to–background coupling observed in G79.29+0.46 may represent a scaled analogue
of energy and information release processes in compact objects. If temporal density gradients indeed
govern such transitions, then the emergence of jets from within strongly curved regions could reflect
the same fundamental mechanism - a controlled re-coupling of segmented spacetime to the
surrounding metric.


23


**9. Conclusion**


**9.1 Summary in Four Points**


**1.** **Gravitation segments spacetime** . The temporal density field 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) defines a layered

geometry in which local time flow varies continuously with curvature. This segmentation
explains temperature gradients, velocity fields, and molecular stability within expanding
nebulae.

**2.** **Time dilation generates both mass and radio emission.** The integrated field



𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =



𝑐 [2]



𝐺 [∫𝛾][𝑠𝑒𝑔][(𝑟)𝑑𝑟 ] [reproduces the empirical core mass of G79.29+0.46 without ]



invoking additional dark components. The same factor 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) < 1 redshifts inner emission
into the radio domain, linking matter formation and radiative propagation through one
mechanism.

**3.** **LBV nebulae as laboratories of segmented structure.** G79.29+0.46, η Carinae, and AG Car

display similar stratified morphologies, making them ideal testbeds for the segmentedspacetime model. Each object exhibits a consistent ratio 𝛥𝑣/𝑣_0 ≅𝑦𝑠𝑒𝑔−1 −1 ~0.1,

independent of scale, luminosity, or chemical composition.

**4.** **Compatibility of relativity and molecular physics.** Segmental time dilation merges relativistic

curvature with molecular thermodynamics. There is no conflict between Einsteinian
geometry and chemical structure; both emerge from the same temporal field.


**9.2 Outlook**


Future work will focus on extending and validating the model through simulation and observation:


- **Numerical modelling** - Full relativistic simulations of Φ(𝑟) ∝ −∫ 1−𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) 𝑑𝑟 to quantify the

𝑟 [2]
energy and mass transfer across segments.

- **Comparative testing** - Application to M 17, AG Carinae, and Cygnus X to verify whether their γₛₑgprofiles reproduce observed CO and [C II] gradients.

- **3D radio-wave mapping** - Synthetic propagation models of 𝑣 [′] = 𝑣 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔(𝑟) to predict spatial
polarization and spectral drift patterns testable with ALMA and SKA.

- **Link to constants** - Exploration of whether the limiting value of 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑔 connects to the fine-structure
constant α, establishing a bridge between quantum electrodynamics and curved-time dynamics.


In summary, segmented spacetime unifies thermodynamics, radiation and gravitation under one
principle: Time itself is not uniform but structured.


The stability of nebulae, the persistence of molecular shells, and the emergence of radio continua all
follow from this architecture of temporally layered curvature.


24


**9.3. Comparative Note: Possible Future Sites of Subspace Formation - The Orion BN/KL Complex**


While G79.29+0.46 provides an example of a mature subspace structure - a Segmented Spacetime
region where curvature has stabilized below the singular threshold - the Orion BN/KL complex may
represent the next generation of such formation. Within Orion’s molecular core, several young,
massive stellar objects (notably BN, Source I, and the Hot Core cluster) already exhibit characteristics
consistent with the early stages of segmentation: strong maser activity, differential time lags across
emission spots, and locally enhanced polarization asymmetries.


In the Segmented Spacetime framework, these signatures indicate an increasing segment density
𝑁(𝑟) approaching the critical threshold 𝑁𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 .


Contrary to the classical expectation of an abrupt supernova explosion after nuclear fuel exhaustion,
the Segmented Spacetime interpretation predicts a gradual emergence of subspace within the stellar
interior, long before any visible collapse. The eventual “supernova” would thus correspond not to a
violent destruction, but to the optical appearance of an already-formed subspatial region reaching
global visibility as 𝑁(𝑟) saturates. In this view, Orion BN/KL marks a probable pre-horizon
environment: A place where the segmentation of space itself may soon become astrophysically
observable, through polarization flips, maser time lags, or non-kinematic redshift components
preceding any classical supernova event.
