where:

- L is the baseline geometric distance in the instantaneous rest frame of the gravitational environment,
- 𝜸𝑮𝑹 is the gravitational scaling factor (encoding gravitational time dilation, Shapiro delay, and local curvature effects),
- 𝜸𝑺𝑹 is the special-relativistic Lorentz factor associated with the peculiar velocity of the source, lens, or observer,
- 𝒗 is the relative velocity along the line of sight,
- 𝝉 is the proper time interval associated with the emitting system.

This provides a physically transparent decomposition:

- 𝜸𝑮𝑹 · 𝑳 contains all gravitational distortions of spacetime affecting light propagation,
- 𝜸𝑺𝑹 · 𝒗 · 𝝉 captures the special-relativistic kinematic effects (including Doppler shifts and time dilation due to motion).

This formulation is structurally analogous to the additive split of relativistic energies,

$$E _ { t o t } = E _ { G R } + E _ { S R } ,$$

highlighting the conceptual similarity between the decomposition of energy contributions and the decomposition of observed light-travel times in lensing scenarios.

In future work, we will apply this decomposition to observational data from strong gravitational lenses to test:

- whether gravitational and kinematic components can be empirically isolated,
- whether this formulation offers practical advantages over the standard Fermat potential approach,
- whether it provides insight into anomalies such as the H₀ tension.

## Additive Decomposition of the Observed Light-Travel Time

Carmen N. Wrede, Lino P. Casu, Bingsi

In gravitational lensing, the observed light-travel time 𝑡 obs is traditionally expressed as the sum of a geometric contribution and a gravitational (Shapiro) delay,

$$t _ { o b s } = t _ { g e o m } + t _ { g r a v }$$

The observed time consists of a geometric part plus a gravitational part.

This representation, used in the Fermat potential formalism, is effective but it mixes several distinct physical mechanisms into only two broad terms.

Here we propose a more explicit additive decomposition in which the geometric, gravitational, and kinematic contributions are separated through distinct Lorentz-type factors.

$$c \, t _ { o b s } = \sum _ { \text {gravitational (Shapiro} + geometry) } \underbrace { \gamma _ { \text {GR} } \, L } _ { \text {gravitational (Shapiro) + geometry) } + \sum _ { \text {special relativistic (kinematic) } } \tau \, \upsilon \, \tau \,$$

## Visibility Threshold and Segment-Based Interpretation

The additive decomposition or, equivalently,

$$c t _ { o b s } = \gamma _ { G R } L + \gamma _ { S R } v \tau$$

makes an additional phenomenon explicit that is usually hidden in the standard lensing equations:

Light becomes observable only when the special-relativistic (SR) coherence of the wave exceeds the gravitational (GR) segmentation imposed by the local spacetime curvature.

In classical relativity, gravitational contributions are often written with a global constant 𝑐 2 . However, physically the relevant scale in the GR term is the local free-fall velocity

$$v _ { f a l l } = \sqrt { \frac { 2 G M } { r } }$$

which quantifies the local gradient of spacetime segmentation. Thus the gravitational contribution to the effective energy is not mc 2 but:

$$E _ { G R } = m v _ { f a l l } ^ { 2 }$$

Electromagnetic waves (especially radio waves) become measurable only when:

$$E _ { S R } > E _ { G R }$$

$$\gamma _ { S R } \, v \tau = \gamma _ { G R } L$$

Near strong gravitational fields (black holes, compact objects), the GR segmentation term 𝜸GRL becomes so large that the SR coherence of the photon wave packet is suppressed.

The wave is physically present, but not observable, because its internal structure is over-segmented by the curvature of spacetime.

As the wave propagates outward and vfall decreases, the segmentation relaxes. Once the SR coherence term overtakes the GR segmentation term, the electromagnetic wave becomes observable again.

We can define a visibility radius r vis as the radius at which the special -relativistic coherence of an electromagnetic wave becomes equal to the gravitational segmentation imposed by the local spacetime curvature. Formally, this corresponds to the threshold condition

$$E _ { S R } = E _ { G R }$$

Using the free -fall velocity vfall(r) = √2GM /r and EGR~m vfall 2 = 2GMm r / , we obtain:

$$r _ { v i s } = \frac { 2 G M } { E _ { S R } / m }$$

If we parameterise the SR contribution by an effective coherence scale v* via ESR~mv* 2 , this becomes

$$r _ { v i s } = \frac { 2 G M } { v _ { * } ^ { 2 } }$$

Low -energy (radio) waves with small ESR (small v* ) thus have a large visibility radius and only reemerge far outside the strong -gravity region, while high -energy photons remain observable much closer to the compact object.

This provides a natural explanation for:

- why radio emission near compact objects appears 'missing,'
- why certain frequencies reappear only beyond a specific radius,
- why low-energy photons emerge from regions that classically appear causally suppressed.

## Interpretation in the segmented-spacetime model

In a segmented spacetime, gravity corresponds to a spatially varying segmentation density. Light becomes observable when the wave packet has enough internal coherence to form a stable segment pattern.

Thus:

- GR determines how much a wave is segmented ,
- SR determines how much coherence the wave can maintain ,
- visibility arises when SR-coherence exceeds GR-segmentation .

This is fully consistent with the decomposition

$$E _ { t o t } = E _ { G R } + E _ { S R }$$

and clarifies why the observed light-travel time naturally contains two independent contributions.

## Implications for gravitational lensing analysis

This refined structure suggests several testable predictions:

- Radio-band visibility thresholds depend on local curvature, not solely on redshift.
- Light-curve delays may contain hidden GR/SR crossover signatures.
- Multi-frequency lensing observations can separate GR segmentation from SR coherence.
- The 'missing radio flux' near compact lenses could be explained without exotic mechanisms.

These predictions will be explored in the forthcoming analysis section using strong-lens systems.
