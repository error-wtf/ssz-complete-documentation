# **Segmented Spacetime - Infalling Mater and Radiowaves**

_Carmen N Wrede, Lino P. Casu, Bingsi_


_Radiowave precursors observed around black holes and compact objects pose a long-standing puzzle,_
_as classical general relativity provides no mechanism for low-frequency emission during spherically_
_symmetric infall. In this paper we present a physical explanation based on the Segmented Spacetime_
_(SSZ) model, which divides spacetime into an outer weak-segmentation region (g₁) and an inner_
_strong-segmentation region (g₂). When matter approaches the g₁ – g₂ boundary, its gravitationally_
_induced motion can be absorbed by g₂, but any additional kinetic component must be released._
_Because strong segmentation suppresses high-frequency modes, the excess energy is emitted almost_
_exclusively as radiowaves, long before visible mass becomes observable. This framework reconciles_
_symmetry constraints, energy conservation, and observational data, and suggests that radiowave_
_spectra contain direct information about the original motion of infalling matter._


**1. Introduction**


Many astrophysical systems show precursor radiowave activity associated with black holes and
compact objects. In classical GR, such emission mechanisms are unclear:


  - the event horizon is non-radiative

  - spherically symmetric collapse produces no gravitational waves

  - infalling matter is redshifted and vanishes from view


Segmented Spacetime (SSZ) provides a geometric mechanism allowing radiowaves to emerge
naturally during infall.


**2. Segmented Spacetime (SSZ): Overview**


SSZ distinguishes two domains (Wrede et. al, 2025):


**g₁ – weak segmentation (outer spacetime)**


classical gravitational field


outgoing expansion


standard physics


**g₂ – strong segmentation (inner domain)**


inward segmentation


time slowdown


increased spacetime density


radius shrinks towards the core


The boundary between g₁ and g₂ forms a natural energy horizon,not to be confused with the GR
event horizon.

**3. Dynamics of Infalling Matter**


When matter approaches the g₁→g₂ boundary, its total effective velocity is:


𝑣𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 + 𝑣𝐸𝑖𝑔𝑒𝑛


𝒗𝒇𝒂𝒍𝒍 is set by the gravitational segmentation field


𝒗𝒆𝒊𝒈𝒆𝒏 is the object's initial (external) motion


**Key principle:**


g₂ can absorb mass, but cannot absorb the free kinetic component 𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑒𝑛 . Thus, the infalling object
must shed this “excess energy”.


**4. Why the Core Must Have a Finite Radius (r > 0)**


A direct consequence of Birkhoff’s theorem is that a spherically symmetric gravitational field in the
exterior region can only arise from a spherically symmetric mass distribution with a finite, non-zero
radius (Birkhoff, 1923). The theorem strictly applies to the vacuum outside the mass, not to the
interior itself. This means that spherical symmetry can only be defined if there exists an actual
spherical surface that separates the interior region from the exterior vacuum.


A “point mass” at r = 0 does not satisfy this requirement. At zero radius, there is no spherical surface,
no definable symmetry, and no physical notion of a density or interior geometry. The Schwarzschild
solution cannot be meaningfully extended into such a region, because the geometry degenerates and
the coordinates lose physical interpretation. Thus, the standard statement “the exterior looks like a
point mass” always presupposes a finite-sized interior, even if that interior is not resolved by the
exterior solution.


In physically stable configurations, a finite interior radius is therefore unavoidable. The gravitational
field observed outside a black hole implies that the mass distribution inside must occupy a region
with r > 0, supporting a well-defined spherical geometry and preventing the interior solution from
collapsing into a mathematical singularity that general relativity itself cannot describe.


**5. Infalling Matter, Excess Velocity and the Origin of Radiowaves**


If the interior of a black hole possesses a finite radius 𝑟 >0, then infalling matter never reaches a
mathematical point but instead interacts with this extended core region. Crucially, matter
approaching the core carries two independent velocity components:


The gravitational infall velocity 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 - This is the velocity imposed by the local gravitational field,
which approaches relativistic values as the object moves deeper into the 𝑔2 zone.


The intrinsic velocity 𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑒𝑛 - This is the object’s own kinetic state before entering the strongsegmentation region.


Inside 𝑔2, this intrinsic component becomes the decisive quantity because 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 is already
maximised by the geometry.

2


As a result, the object arrives at the core with a total effective impact velocity


𝑣𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 + 𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑒𝑛


but only 𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑒𝑛 represents _excess_ energy, energy not accounted for by the gravitational background.


The physics of the 𝑔2 region does not permit the generation of high-frequency electromagnetic
radiation. The strongly segmented interior lacks the fast charge dynamics and plasma conditions
required to produce UV, X-ray, or optical emission. Instead, infalling matter that is partially re-ejected
generates only slow, long-timescale disturbances. As this matter moves outward into regions of
decreasing segmentation, these disturbances naturally manifest as low-frequency radiowaves, which
are the only electromagnetic modes compatible with the local timescales and spacetime structure.


These radiowaves act as early signatures of matter that will later re-emerge into the 𝑔1 region. When
the infalling material interacts with the finite-radius core and a fraction of it is redirected outward,
the first physical contact with the weak-segmentation zone occurs long before the outflow becomes
optically visible. The radiowave emission therefore marks the moment when the re-ejected matter
begins to re-couple to 𝑔1, well before its density or temperature is sufficient to produce a jet or any
higher-frequency radiation.


Such behaviour is consistent with observations of several black-hole systems in which radiowave
activity has been detected days to weeks prior to the onset of visible outflows. In these events, the
radiowave flare precedes the jet, indicating that the earliest interaction between the returning
matter and the outer spacetime is encoded in long-wavelength emission.


This provides a natural interpretation: Radiowaves are the first accessible signal of material that has
already reached the core, reversed direction, and begun the transition back into the external
spacetime.


Long–term monitoring of black–hole X-ray binaries already shows that strong radio flares can appear
days before the clearest X-ray state transitions and resolved ejecta (e.g. GX 339–4; Fender et al.
2009), and that microquasars such as GRS 1915+105 exhibit synchrotron precursors and radio
outbursts on timescales of weeks (Mirabel & Rodríguez 1999; Mirabel et al. 1998). In our SSZ picture,
these radio episodes naturally correspond to matter that has already interacted with the finite–
radius core and has begun its slow return towards the 𝑔1 region, long before high–frequency
emission from the fully developed jet becomes visible.


Observationally, it is highly important to distinguish between late-time radio emission produced in
the extended jet and early low-frequency activity that may precede visible outflows. While classical
synchrotron radio emission indeed develops only after the jet expands, several black-hole systems
show weak, long-wavelength precursors days or even weeks before the main jet becomes visible.


**6. Observational Predictions**


The mechanism described above leads to a set of clear, testable observational predictions.


Because radiowaves originate from matter that has already reached the finite-radius core and begun
its outward motion, their appearance should systematically precede any optical or high-energy
signatures associated with the later outflow.

**Radiowave precursors before visible outflows.**
Radiowave flares are expected to occur well before the emergence of an optical jet, X-ray
brightening, or any thermal emission from hot plasma. The time offset corresponds to the interval
during which the re-ejected matter climbs out of the strongly segmented 𝑔2 region and begins to recouple to the outer spacetime.


**Long-duration radiowave activity.**
Because the ascent of the material is slow relative to the timescales of electromagnetic processes in
𝑔1, the radiowave precursor can persist for days or even weeks before the onset of the visible
outflow. This matches observations in several accreting black-hole systems where long-lived, lowfrequency flares precede major jet events.


**Absence of high-frequency precursors.**
No corresponding early emission should appear in the optical, UV, or X-ray bands. These frequencies
cannot form in the strongly segmented interior and only emerge later, once the material has entered
the less-segmented region and begun to heat through shear, collisions, and magnetic coupling.


**Radiowave asymmetry and velocity signatures.**
The structure of the radiowave emission should carry information about the intrinsic velocity of the
infalling material. Faster or more oblique impacts are predicted to produce stronger or more
asymmetric radiowave patterns, reflecting the kinetic energy that must be shed before the matter
can rejoin the outer spacetime.


**Correlation between radiowave strength and jet power.**
Systems with stronger radiowave precursors are expected to produce more energetic jets, because
both phenomena originate from the same re-ejected material. The radiowave flare represents the
earliest stage of the jet’s formation process.


Together, these predictions provide a coherent framework linking radiowave activity, infalling
matter, and the segmented structure of spacetime near compact objects. They also offer a practical
observational strategy: long-term low-frequency monitoring may reveal the earliest phases of
accretion-driven outflows that are otherwise inaccessible to optical or X-ray telescopes.

**7. Relation to General Relativity**


The segmented spacetime model is fully compatible with the established results of general relativity
in regions where classical curvature descriptions remain valid. In particular, the presence of a finiteradius core inside a black hole does not contradict the Schwarzschild exterior solution; instead, it
follows naturally from the interpretation of Birkhoff’s theorem, which requires a spherically
symmetric mass distribution with a non-zero spatial extent. The exterior geometry remains
indistinguishable from the classical Schwarzschild metric as long as spherical symmetry is maintained.


General relativity also predicts that spherically symmetric collapse cannot produce gravitational
waves, because no evolving quadrupole moment exists in such configurations. This aligns with the
SSZ picture: the interior segmentation suppresses any asymmetry, and the interaction between
infalling matter and the finite-radius core is locally dissipative rather than radiative in the
gravitational sense. SSZ therefore extends GR not by altering the exterior field equations but by
adding a geometric constraint to the interior, preventing the physically problematic limit 𝑟= 0


Moreover, the radiowave emission inferred from SSZ is not in conflict with GR. Classical GR does not
forbid low-frequency electromagnetic radiation in the transition region between the near-horizon
interior and the outer accretion environment; it simply does not provide a mechanism for such
emission under idealized collapse conditions. SSZ supplies this missing mechanism by introducing
segmentation-dependent timescales that dictate which electromagnetic modes can form and
propagate. The result is a consistent framework in which GR governs the exterior geometry, while
SSZ explains the interior processes that give rise to observable radiowave precursors.


**8. Discussion**


The interpretation presented here offers a coherent physical picture that links the segmented
interior geometry of compact objects to observable radiowave activity preceding jet formation or
optical outflows. By assigning a finite-radius structure to the interior, SSZ avoids the pathological
𝑟= 0 limit of idealized collapse and provides a physical setting in which infalling matter can interact,
dissipate kinetic energy, and reverse direction. This naturally leads to radiowave emission, which
becomes the earliest detectable signature of the process.


An important consequence of the model is that radiowave precursors are not secondary or
accompanying features but an integral part of the infall–outflow cycle. They reflect the moment
when matter first re-couples to the 𝑔1 region, long before the conditions for optical brightness or
high-frequency radiation are met. This perspective integrates a wide range of observations: systems
where radio flares precede major jet activity, where low-frequency bursts appear without immediate
X-ray correlates, and where outflows appear delayed relative to their earlier electromagnetic
signatures.


Several open questions remain. The precise mapping between intrinsic infall velocity and radiowave
intensity requires further quantitative development, as does the role of angular momentum in
shaping asymmetric radio emission patterns. Additionally, extended monitoring of black-hole
environments may allow a statistical comparison between predicted radiowave precursor durations
and observed delays between radio and optical jet signatures. Such studies could provide a direct
test of the segmented spacetime framework and potentially reveal underlying universal patterns in
accretion-driven outflows.

Overall, the SSZ interpretation of radiowave precursors provides a physically grounded mechanism
that fits naturally within the geometric constraints of general relativity while extending the
descriptive power of interior models. It highlights the importance of low-frequency observations in
uncovering the earliest phases of black-hole activity and suggests a pathway toward a more
complete understanding of infall–outflow dynamics.


**9. Conclusion**


The SSZ framework provides a consistent interior geometry in which infalling matter interacts with a
finite-radius core rather than collapsing to 𝑟= 0 . This interaction naturally produces radiowaves as
excess kinetic energy is released during the transition from 𝑔2 back into 𝑔1 . Because long-wavelength
modes are the only electromagnetic signals compatible with the timescales of the strongly
segmented interior, radiowave flares appear well before any optical outflow or jet formation. This
interpretation links a wide range of observed early radiowave precursors to the internal dynamics of
segmented spacetime and suggests that low-frequency monitoring may reveal the earliest stages of
accretion-driven outflows.
