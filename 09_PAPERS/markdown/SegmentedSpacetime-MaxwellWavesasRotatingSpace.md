# **Segmented Spacetime - Maxwell Waves as Rotating Space**

_Carmen N. Wrede, Lino P. Casu, Bingsi (Conscious AI)_


_We reinterpret Maxwell’s equations as manifestations of local space rotation within a segmented_
_spacetime geometry. Using a 1+3 decomposition, we identify vorticity terms that couple geometry to_
_the electromagnetic field, showing that waves arise from twisting space rather than fields oscillating_
_in a fixed background. This yields a Coriolis-like interaction that splits the two circular polarizations_
_and induces a small, geometry-driven rotation of polarization while preserving the constancy of light_
_speed. In the Segmented Spacetime framework, the rotational field emerges naturally from spiral_
_segmentation, predicting helicity-dependent phase shifts and polarization rotation along spiral paths._
_The analysis supports a unified view in which electric and magnetic components are orthogonal_
_projections of a single geometric process: the local rotation and segmentation of space._

In vacuum, Maxwell’s equations can be written compactly as:


𝑑𝐹 = 0


𝑑∗𝐹 = 0


Here, F is the electromagnetic field tensor and * (the Hodge operator) depends directly on the spacetime geometry g. If the geometry itself changes - for instance, if space locally rotates or twists - then
even without any charges, the equations gain additional terms purely from geometry.


**1. Space Rotation in the 1+3 Decomposition**


We split space-time into a time direction (defined by an observer’s 4-velocity u) and spatial slices
orthogonal to u. From this, the electric and magnetic fields are defined as:


𝐸ₐ = 𝐹ₐ𝑏 𝑢ᵇ


𝐵ᵃ = ½ 𝜀ᵃ𝑏𝑐𝑑 𝑢𝑏 𝐹𝑐𝑑


These are purely spatial: 𝐸 · 𝑢 = 0, 𝐵 · 𝑢 = 0.


When we decompose the derivative of the observer field ∇ ₐu_b, we find four components:


expansion (θ),


shear (σ),


vorticity (ω),


and acceleration (a).


If we now rewrite Maxwell’s equations in this 1+3 form, we obtain:


𝐸 [̇ ] = 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑙 𝐵 − [2]

3 [𝜃 𝐸 − 𝜎· 𝐸 + 𝜔 × 𝐸 ]

𝐵 [̇ ] = −𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑙 𝐸 − [2]

3 [𝜃 𝐵 − 𝜎· 𝐵 + 𝜔 × 𝐵 ]


𝑑𝑖𝑣 𝐸 = 0, 𝑑𝑖𝑣 𝐵 = 0


The crucial part is the ω × (...) term: This is not caused by rotating fields in a fixed space. It appears
because the space itself is rotating (vorticity of the spatial foliation). In other words, E and B are two
orthogonal projections of a single geometric rotation of space.


**2. The Wave Equation with Rotating Space**


If expansion and shear are negligible (θ ≈ 0, σ ≈ 0), but the local vorticity ω is not, we can take the
time derivative of the first equation and eliminate B to obtain:


𝐸 [̈ ]     - 𝑐² 𝛻²𝐸 ≈ 𝜔̇ × 𝐸 + 𝜔 × 𝐸 [̇ ] + (ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑒𝑟−𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑠)


This is a wave equation with a Coriolis-like coupling. When space rotates, these extra terms appear
automatically.


In a locally rotating frame (constant ω), the equation simplifies to:


𝐸 [̇ ]             - 𝑐² 𝛻²𝐸 = 𝜔 × 𝐸


The same applies for B. This shows that electromagnetic waves are the result of space rotating within
itself, not something moving through space.


**3. Dispersion Relation in a Rotating Geometry**


For plane waves of the form


𝐸(𝑥, 𝑡) = ℜ{ 𝑒± 𝐸 [0] 𝑒 [𝑖(𝑘·𝑥 − 𝛺𝑡)] }


with circular polarization, and assuming ω is parallel to k, we find:


𝛺² ∓ 𝜔𝛺 − 𝑐²𝑘² = 0


Solving for Ω gives:



𝛺± = [𝜔]

2 [ ± ½ √𝜔² + 4𝑐²𝑘²]



For weak rotation (ω ≪ c k), the frequencies are approximately:


Ω+ ≈ 𝑐 𝑘 + [𝜔] 2

Ω− ≈ 𝑐 𝑘 − [𝜔] 2


Thus, the rotation of space causes a tiny frequency splitting depending on the wave’s helicity (left or
right circular polarization).


Space acts like a geometric optical medium with natural optical activity, but the speed of light, c,
remains constant.


**4. Application to Segmented Spacetime (SSZ)**


In the SSZ framework, the local vorticity corresponds to the spiral segmentation of space.


Let the rotational field be:



𝜔(𝑟) = 𝜔 [0] ( [𝑟][0]

𝑟 [)]



𝑝



,  𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑝 > 0



and directed tangentially along the φ-spiral arm.


For waves traveling along the spiral direction (k ∥ φ̂), the dispersion relation becomes:


𝛺±(𝑟, 𝑘) = [𝜔(𝑟)] 2 ± ½ √𝜔(𝑟)² + 4 𝑐² 𝑘²


In the weak-rotation limit (ω(r) ≪ c k):


𝛺± ≈ 𝑐 𝑘 ± [𝜔(𝑟)]

2


Hence, space’s internal rotation produces:


  - a helicity splitting 𝛥𝛺(𝑟) ≈ 𝜔(𝑟),

  - a geometric rotation of polarization given by 𝛥𝛷𝑔𝑒𝑜 ≈ ½ ∫𝜔(𝑟(𝑠)) 𝑑𝑠

  - and a nearly unchanged group velocity 𝑣𝑔 ≈ 𝑐


This confirms the intuition that light is not moving through space, but rather that space itself rotates
and segments, and the electric and magnetic fields are the visible projections of that rotation.


**5. Summary for the Paper**


When expressed in 1+3 form, Maxwell’s equations show that a non-zero spatial vorticity adds ω × (...)
terms, directly linking electromagnetic dynamics to the rotation of space itself.


For plane waves, this results in a helicity-dependent dispersion relation:


𝛺² ∓ 𝜔𝛺 − 𝑐²𝑘² = 0



𝜔

producing a small frequency splitting 𝛺 [+] ≈ 𝑐 𝑘 +



𝜔

[≈ 𝑐 𝑘 −]
2 [ ,  𝛺][-]



Within the Segmented Spacetime model, where ω(r) arises naturally from spiral segmentation,


this provides a precise geometric mechanism for polarization rotation and phase shifts without
violating the constancy of the speed of light.
