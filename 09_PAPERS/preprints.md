# Historical Preprints & Consolidation

## Canonical vs Preprint Versions

The canonical short versions (paper_NN) are the reference for the book. Full preprints contain additional derivation detail.

| Paper | Short (KB) | Preprint (KB) | Extra Detail |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 01 Radial Scaling | 4 | 14 | +10 KB |
| 02 Dual Velocities | 4 | 12 | +8 KB |
| 03 Frequency Framework | 4 | 69 | +65 KB |
| 04 Complete Metric | 5 | 25 | +20 KB |
| 05 Infalling Matter | 4 | 16 | +12 KB |
| 08 Group Velocity | 3 | 127 | +124 KB |
| 09 Dark Star | 3 | 16 | +13 KB |
| 10 Curvature Detection | 3 | 25 | +22 KB |
| 11 Molecular Zones | 3 | 61 | +58 KB |
| 14 Emergent Axes | 3 | 521 | +518 KB |
| 17 Cosmic Censorship | 3 | 53 | +50 KB |

The 5 largest preprints contain ~830 KB of additional material.

## Consolidation Rules

1. **Canonical short version** (paper_NN) is always the structural reference
2. **Preprint** is consulted for additional derivations and details
3. On conflict: **short version wins**
4. All formulas must match the canonical formula compendium
5. Deprecated formulas from older preprints are NOT adopted
