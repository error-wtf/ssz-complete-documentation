# Frequency-Based Curvature Detection

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Paper:** 10 — Frequency-Based Curvature Detection via Dynamic Comparisons

---

## Concept

Curvature in SSZ is not measured through geodesic deviation but through **frequency comparisons** between spatially separated clocks. The segment density Ξ(r) directly encodes the local curvature, making frequency the fundamental observable.

---

## Method

1. Place two clocks at different radii r₁, r₂
2. Compare their frequencies: ν₁/ν₂ = D(r₁)/D(r₂)
3. The ratio encodes the difference in segment density
4. Curvature is inferred from the gradient dΞ/dr

---

## Key Formula

```
D(r) = 1/(1 + Ξ(r))
ν_obs/ν_emit = D(r_obs)/D(r_emit)
```
