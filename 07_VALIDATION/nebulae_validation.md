# Molecular Zones in Expanding Nebulae

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Paper:** 11 — Segmented Spacetime and the Origin of Molecular Zones in Expanding Nebulae

---

## Concept

SSZ predicts that expanding nebulae exhibit molecular zone structures that arise from segmentation-dependent scaling of physical processes. The G79.29+0.46 LBV nebula serves as primary test case.

---

## Key Predictions

- Temperature inversion in expanding shells explained by segment density gradients
- NH3 velocity profiles consistent with SSZ scaling
- Molecular zone boundaries correlate with regime transitions

---

## Validation

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| NH3 velocity match | PASS |
| Temperature inversion | Confirmed |
| Radial profile | Consistent with SSZ scaling |
