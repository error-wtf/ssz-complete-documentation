## Local Lorentz Invariance in SSZ

SSZ maintains local Lorentz invariance by construction:
- The speed of light c is locally invariant
- Effects arise from geometry/path + clock mapping, not local speed changes
- The segment density Ξ modifies the clock rate, not the local physics

## Connection to Frame Dragging

Paper 24 establishes the connection between:
- SSZ's transformation-based definition of local invariance
- Classical frame-dragging effects (Lense-Thirring, geodetic precession)

The key insight: SSZ's time dilation factor D(r) is consistent with the frame-dragging predictions of GR in the weak field, while providing a finite, well-behaved description in the strong field.

## Implications

- No violation of local Lorentz symmetry
- Frame-dragging effects are reproduced in the PPN limit
- Strong-field modifications come from Ξ saturation, not symmetry breaking
