# Falsification Criteria

**Status:** CANONICAL

---

## SSZ Would Be DEFINITIVELY FALSIFIED If:

### 1. Neutron Star Redshift
```
z_obs ≠ z_SSZ ± 5%
```
SSZ predicts z_SSZ = z_GR + 13%. If observed NS redshifts match GR exactly (or are lower), SSZ is wrong.

**Instrument:** NICER, XMM-Newton
**Timeline:** 2025–2027

### 2. Pulsar Timing
```
Δt_obs ≠ Δt_SSZ ± 10%
```
SSZ predicts enhanced Shapiro delays near compact objects.

**Instrument:** NANOGrav, SKA
**Timeline:** 2025–2028

### 3. Universal Intersection Point
```
r*/r_s ≠ 1.595 ± 0.01
```
The mass-independent intersection point is a hard geometric prediction. If observations of multiple compact objects show no convergence at this value, SSZ fails.

**Method:** Multi-object NS comparison
**Timeline:** Ongoing

### 4. Black Hole Shadow
```
Shadow diameter inconsistent with D_SSZ(r_s) = 0.555
```
SSZ predicts a slightly smaller shadow (-1.3% vs GR). If ngEHT measures a shadow consistent with GR's D(r_s) = 0, SSZ is falsified.

**Instrument:** ngEHT
**Timeline:** 2028–2030

## SSZ Would Be SUPPORTED If:

1. NS redshifts systematically exceed GR by ~13%
2. Pulsar timing shows enhanced delays consistent with SSZ
3. BH shadow is slightly smaller than GR prediction
4. Multiple compact objects converge on r*/r_s = 1.595
5. No information loss signatures at horizons

---

## Design Philosophy

SSZ is deliberately constructed to be **easily falsifiable**:
- Zero free parameters → no knobs to adjust
- Specific numerical predictions → clear pass/fail
- Forward prediction only → no post-hoc fitting
- Multiple independent tests → overdetermined

> Quick rejection is a feature, not a bug.
