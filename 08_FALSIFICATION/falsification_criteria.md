## What Would Definitively Falsify SSZ?

| Measurement | SSZ Falsified If | Confidence |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| NS redshift | z_obs = z_GR ± 5% (not z_SSZ) | 3σ |
| Pulsar timing | Δt_obs = Δt_GR ± 10% (not Δt_SSZ) | 3σ |
| r*/r_s | Value ≠ 1.595 ± 0.01 | Direct |
| D(r_s) | Consistent with D=0 (GR) | Conceptual |

## The Falsifiability Principle

SSZ is designed to be **easily falsifiable**:

1. **No post-hoc adjustment:** If a prediction fails, SSZ is wrong. No parameter tuning.
2. **Clear numerical targets:** Specific % deviations from GR are predicted.
3. **Timeline:** Most tests feasible within 2025–2030.
4. **Multiple independent tests:** Failure of any single prediction is sufficient.

## What Would NOT Falsify SSZ

- Weak-field measurements agreeing with GR (expected — SSZ = GR there)
- Numerical precision issues in code (implementation, not physics)
- Different repos giving different-looking results (different scopes/methods)
- Finding that φ is "just a number" (SSZ works regardless of philosophical interpretation)

## The Decisive Experiments

### 1. NICER NS Redshift (2025–2027)
Most imminent test. If high-quality NS surface redshifts match GR within 5%, SSZ is in serious trouble.

### 2. NANOGrav Pulsar Timing (2025–2028)
Pulsar timing arrays should show SSZ's predicted +30% excess if SSZ is correct.

### 3. ngEHT BH Shadow (2028–2030)
Next-generation Event Horizon Telescope can resolve the predicted -1.3% shadow size difference.

### 4. Multi-NS r* Measurement (2027+)
If multiple neutron stars show the same r*/r_s = 1.595 intersection independent of mass, this is strong SSZ evidence.
