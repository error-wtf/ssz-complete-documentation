# Known Limitations

## What SSZ Does NOT Cover

### 1. Quantum Gravity
SSZ is a **phenomenological framework**, not a quantum theory of gravity. It does not:
- Derive Ξ from quantum mechanics
- Explain the microphysical origin of segmentation
- Make Planck-scale predictions

### 2. Full Cosmology
SSZ's cosmology module is a **constraint scaffold**, not a complete FLRW alternative:
- It checks whether SSZ disturbs CMB/BBN/growth
- It does NOT provide a full dark energy explanation
- It does NOT replace ΛCDM

### 3. Gravitational Waves (Full Treatment)
- SSZ modifies the metric → gravitational wave propagation is affected
- But a complete GW waveform calculation in SSZ is not yet available
- Ringdown frequency predictions exist but need full numerical relativity

### 4. Rotating Black Holes (Full Kerr)
- SSZ currently treats the Schwarzschild (non-rotating) case in detail
- Kerr extension is outlined but not fully computed
- Frame dragging uses PPN approximation

## Known Precision Limits

### Blend Zone
The Hermite C² interpolation at 1.8–2.2 r/r_s is smooth but introduces a ~0.1% uncertainty band in the transition region.

### Mass-Dependent Correction
The Δ(M) correction:
```
Δ(M) = A · exp(-α/M^B)
```
is derived from φ-geometry but has limited observational verification for extreme masses.

### Strong Lensing
Strong-field lensing predictions exist but have not been tested against data (no suitable strong-lensing measurements near neutron stars yet).

## What SSZ Claims It IS

1. A **falsifiable extension** of GR
2. A **forward predictor** with zero free parameters
3. A **test harness** for strong-field deviations
4. **Consistent with all existing** weak-field observations
5. **Specific and testable** in the strong field

---

## What SSZ Does NOT Claim

1. NOT that spacetime is literally a discrete lattice
2. NOT that there is a specific microphysical segmentation mechanism
3. NOT that it replaces GR in any tested regime
4. NOT that it explains dark energy or dark matter
5. NOT that φ has a fundamental-physics derivation (yet)
